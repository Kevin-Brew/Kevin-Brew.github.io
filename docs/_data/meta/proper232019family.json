    "raw_text": "PROPER 23 \u2013 YEAR C \u2013 2019 \u2013 Family Service\n\nWell as they say \u2013 the attitude is gratitude. Talking about being thankful. Thankful for our beautiful world \u2013 a beautiful world that has been scarred by pollution. How can we be thankful for our beautiful world? We\u2019re alive \u2013 some of us may be creaking a bit \u2013 but we\u2019re alive. Senior Infants in Assembly were talking about this on Friday \u2013 we are all different \u2013 we are each unique \u2013 we are each special.\n\nPeople haven\u2019t always seen it that way \u2013 discrimination on the basis of race. Discrimination on the basis of religion. How can we be thankful \u2013 Senior Infants reminded me that we see everyone as unique, everyone as special \u2013 we are each made in the image of God.\n\nWe are loved by God \u2013 in the person of Jesus God says to each one of us \u2018I love you\u2019. In the Bible we read of the many different ways he showed that \u2013 in his teaching, in his healing, in his death and resurrection. Read today of Jesus healing ten people \u2013 only one came back to say \u2018Thank you\u2019 As he said thank you something special happened to this man \u2013 Jesus said Get up. On your way. Your faith has healed and saved you.\n\nWhen Jesus says \u2018I love you\u2019, he invites us to love him back. I\u2019ll be asking people do they want to go forward for Confirmation soon. We\u2019ll be talking about lots of things. I\u2019ll be talking about communion. In the Communion Service as I invite people to come forward to take the bread and wine I will say \u2018Draw near with faith \u2026. Remember that he died for you and feed on him in your heart.\u2019 It is as I heard that said in Church over and over again that I came to realise that God loved me and I began to think more about how I can love him more. In the way I respect his creation. In the way I respect other people. In the priority I give to being with him in times of quiet, in times of worship.",

    "prompt": "Create a black and white pencil drawing that depicts a person standing on a hilltop, overlooking a panoramic view of a diverse landscape that includes a forest, a river, mountains, and a city skyline in the distance. The person is depicted with arms outstretched towards the sky in a gesture of thankfulness and awe. The landscape should show a contrast between the natural beauty and the signs of human impact, such as a smokestack in the city and a slight smog over the skyline, but the overall tone is one of harmony and appreciation. The person's pose and the surrounding nature should evoke a sense of gratitude and respect for the world's beauty, despite its scars. The drawing should be detailed, with attention to the textures of the trees, water, and clouds, conveying a deep connection between the human figure and the environment.",
    "summary": "From the sermon text provided, here are the top four concepts:\n\n1. Gratitude for the world: The importance of being thankful for the beauty of the world despite its imperfections, such as pollution.\n2. Uniqueness and diversity: The recognition that every person is unique and special, and the rejection of discrimination based on race or religion.\n3. Healing and thankfulness: The story of Jesus healing ten people and the significance of the one who returned to express gratitude, demonstrating the connection between faith, healing, and thankfulness.\n4. Love and response: The love of God as expressed through Jesus and the invitation for individuals to love back, including the practices of confirmation, communion, and personal devotion.\n\nFor a non-religious black and white pencil diagram that can be created without text, the concept of \"Gratitude for the world\" might be the most suitable, as it can be represented in a universal way without specific religious symbols.\n\nHere is a detailed prompt for DALL-E 3 to create an image for the concept of \"Gratitude for the world\":\n\n\"Create a black and white pencil drawing that depicts a person standing on a hilltop, overlooking a panoramic view of a diverse landscape that includes a forest, a river, mountains, and a city skyline in the distance.
