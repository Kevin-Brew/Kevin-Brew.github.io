This is the horrendous price that peace is sometimes asked to pay.\nThis is what makes the eucharistic sacrifice life-giving and not some\nhistorical death cult. And this is the sacrifice that Father Jacques was\ncelebrating as he died. He died as a priest, doing what priests do. May he\nrest in peace and rise in glory.\nGiles Fraser \u2013 ex priest writing in the Guardian\nHe was constantly searching how to give concrete form to heartfelt\ncompassion, especially towards the poor. He liked to quote Saint\nAugustine: \u201cLove, and say it with your life.\u201d This sometimes led him to\nsurprising steps. On one occasion, he came back from a stay in Calcutta\nwith a baby in his arms, a little girl that Mother Teresa had entrusted to him,\nin the hope that going to Europe would save her life \u2013 which turned out to\nbe true. He also welcomed to the village of Taiz\u00e9 and helped to settle there\ntwo widows from Vietnam, with their large families of children, whom he\nhad met while visiting a refugee camp in Thailand.\nThe need to be concrete: this characteristic of his was also seen in his gift\nfor arranging a room or a house. He did not like to construct buildings.\nWhen this was absolutely necessary, they had to be quite simple, very low,\nand if possible built with re-used material. But he loved transforming\nplaces. Using very little, he tried to create beauty. At a certain point a new\nchurch had to be built at Taiz\u00e9, but he resisted the project for a long time,\nand afterwards he was continually adapting and changing the\narrangements. I noticed this even in the impoverished neighbourhood of\nMathare Valley in Kenya, where we stayed for a few weeks before some of\nthe brothers came to live there for many years. In that poor shack in the\nmidst of squalor, he found a way of adding some beauty, using almost\nnothing. As he used to say, we would like to do everything to make life\nbeautiful for those around us.\nBrother Roger often referred to the Beatitudes, and he sometimes said\nabout himself: Je suis un pauvre, \u201cI am a poor man.\u201d He called us, the\nbrothers, not to be spiritual masters but people who listen. He referred to\nhis ministry as prior as being a \u201cpoor servant of communion within the\ncommunity\u201d. He did not hide his vulnerability.\nNow, our little community feels impelled to continue along the way he\nopened up. It is a way of trust. For him the word \u201ctrust\u201d was not a facile\nexpression. It contains an appeal: to welcome very simply the love that God\nbears towards everyone, to root our lives in that love, and to take the risks\nthat that implies.\nTo lose that intuition would lead us to impose burdens on those who come\nseeking the living water. Faith in this love is a wholly simple reality, so\nsimple that everyone can receive it. And this faith can move mountains.\nThen, even if the world is often torn apart by violence and conflict, the way\nwe look on it can be filled with hope.\nBrother Alois"
