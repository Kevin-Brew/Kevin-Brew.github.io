With full assurance of faith, abounding in hope, the bishop prays the confirmation prayer and rooted and grounded in love. Almighty and everliving God, whose Son Jesus Christ was crucified and rose again to break the power of sin and death. We give thanks and praise for the gift of your Holy Spirit by whom your servants have been born again and made your children. Grant that in the power of the same Holy Spirit they may continue to grow in the knowledge and likeness of Christ; to whom with you and the Holy Spirit, belong glory and honour, worship and praise, now and for ever. Amen.

> "Then the LORD God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the man became a living being." - Genesis 2:6.

Those to be confirmed kneel before the bishop, who lays his hand upon the head of each one, saying, "Confirm, O Lord, with your heavenly grace, that he/she may continue to be yours forever, and daily increase in your Holy Spirit more and more until he/she comes to your eternal kingdom."

During ordination, the bishop lays hands on the head of each candidate and says, "Pour out your Holy Spirit upon them for the office and work of a deacon in your Church." The bishop continues, "Fill them with grace and power that they may fulfil their ministry. Make them faithful to serve, ready to teach, constant in advancing your Gospel, proclaiming by word and action the word of salvation."

> "All scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness." - 2 Timothy 3:16.
