    "blurb": "This sermon tells the story of Arteban, the fourth wise man who was always late but for good reasons. He used his gifts, originally intended for the King, to help others in need. He saved a sick man, a baby, and a slave girl, only to realize that in doing so, he had given his gifts to the King.",
    "raw_text": "How many wise men were there? Tradition is three \u2013 Caspar, Melchior and Balthasar \u2013 bible does not say. There is a story of a 4th wise man called Arteban, a friend of the other three, story has it he was a very clever, very compassionate doctor.\n\nPlan was for Arteban to travel with the other three to visit the King \u2013 he was going to bring jewels, diamond, ruby and a pearl. He was always late \u2013 but for a very good reason \u2013 on his way to meet them he came across a sick man by the roadside \u2013 he stopped to look after him until he was better \u2013 but friends went on without him.\n\nNeeded to organise his own transport \u2013 to hire a camel train he had to sell one of his jewels \u2013 most beautiful pearl \u2013 at least I will have the other two to give to the King.\n\nArrived in Bethlehem \u2013 late \u2013 the family had gone \u2013 story had it to Egypt \u2013 he stayed in a house for the night planning to follow. During the night he awakened to a sound of shouting and screaming \u2013 soldiers had come to the town with orders to kill every baby under two \u2013 there was a baby in the house \u2013 then there was a hammering on the door \u2013 Arteban told the family to stay very quiet \u2013 he went to the door \u2013 a soldier was there, his sword dripping with blood \u2013 Arteban took the ruby out of his pocket and waved it under the nose of the soldier \u2013 the soldier grinned with greed, took the jewel and left \u2013 he now only had his diamond \u2013 but at least the child was safe and he still had his diamond to give to the King.\n\nHe went on down into Egypt \u2013 looked for the family but never found them. Spent the next 30 years working as a doctor until he decided he would like to spent his last years at home.\n\nStill with the diamond in his pocket he travelled home through Jerusalem - arrived at time of Passover \u2013 great excitement \u2013 there was crucifixion on \u2013 one of the victims sounded like the King he had been seeking \u2013 thought I could buy his life with the diamond.\n\nOn his way out of the city came across a slave girl being chased by a gang of men \u2013 hid behind him \u2013 they ordered him to get out of the way. She was hers and they were going to deal with her. Reached into his pocket \u2013 took out the diamond \u2013 gave it to the men and said \u2018She is now mine \u2013 leave her alone.\u2019 Turned to the girl and said \u2018You are now free\u2019\n\nNow no gifts left \u2013 wandered sadly back into town \u2013 earthquake \u2013 hit by rubble \u2013 fell to the ground \u2013 crowd gathered round, heard him mumbling \u2018Lord when did I see you sick, or hungry, or in prison and visit you?\u2019\n\nVoice seemed to come from heaven \u2018As much as you did it to the least of these brothers of mine you did it to me.\u2019 Arteban smiled and died knowing that the King had received his gifts.",

    "prompt": "Create a detailed black and white pencil drawing that illustrates the concept of compassion and sacrifice. The scene should depict a serene and wise-looking man in ancient traveler's attire, kneeling down beside a sick person lying by the roadside in a desert landscape. The man is offering a cup of water to the sick person, showcasing a moment of pure kindness. In the background, a camel train can be seen departing, symbolizing the sacrifice the man is making by staying behind. The sky should be vast and open, suggesting the beginning of a long and solitary journey. No religious symbols should be present, and the focus should be on the human interaction and the act of giving. The overall tone should convey a sense of tranquility, empathy, and the beauty of selfless acts.",
