St Mark’s Ballysillan

Let us voice our cares and concerns, knowing that God is listening to us.

> Lord make yourself known to people who come into our Churches, or who pass by and sometimes wonder, but have not yet come in. So we pray for the mission of the Church, for this Diocese and for George our Bishop. We pray for ourselves, help us to take more seriously our responsibility of encouraging one another forward into faith, as brothers and sisters. Lord in your mercy: hear our prayer.

> Lord God, the world lurches from crisis to crisis, and there is so much misleading and misdirection. We continue to pray for the people of Ukraine, for all those entrusted with leadership, those who minister to injured, the bereaved, the frightened. We pray for this Province, for Charles our King, and for all those called to leadership at this time. Help us to recover the natural sense of what is right and just, honest and good, so that our hearts are inclined to hear the voice of your leading and respond to it. Lord in your mercy: hear our prayer.

> Lord God, there are some who are going through very distressing and worrying times. We pray for all who are sick, remembering especially those known to us; those anxious for themselves or for loved ones. In a few moments of silence, we stand alongside them now and ask for them your comfort, reassurance, healing and peace of mind. Lord in your mercy: hear our prayer.

> We pray for all who mourn. We give thanks for all those who have gone before us in the faith, those in whom we have seen something of the light of Christ; we pray that we may share with them the joys of your perfect Kingdom. Lord in your mercy: hear our prayer.

Merciful Father, accept these our prayers for the sake of your Son, our Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen
