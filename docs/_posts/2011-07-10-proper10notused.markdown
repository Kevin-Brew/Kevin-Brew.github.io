Proper 10 – 2011 – year A – Trinity 3

Today sees the final publication of the News of the World, the center of the phone hacking scandal. The paper's slogan, 'All human life is here,' resonates with the Bible, which portrays humanity at its best and worst, from deep despair to exultation.

We've been reading from Genesis, moving on to Jacob's story, which we'll follow for the next few weeks. It's a very human story with God involved at each stage, from God’s call to Abraham to leave his homeland to the promise of descendants. Despite setbacks, such as Sarai's barrenness and the demand on Abraham to sacrifice Isaac, God's grace is evident at each stage.

The complex story of Jacob includes intrigues, jealousies, and resentments. Jacob obtains the birthright and blessing due to Esau, causing a rift between the brothers. He is tricked into marrying Rachel's less attractive sister but remains devoted to Rachel, working another seven years for her.

Jacob, like his ancestors, is a real human being with strengths and failings. Yet, it is through Jacob that God chooses to act. The key lies in 'grace.' As Philip Yancey's book 'What's So Amazing About Grace?' suggests, God's love is unconditional and unmerited.

This common thread runs through the Bible. God worked through Jacob, David, Peter, and Paul, despite their frailties. God takes us, in all our strengths and weaknesses, and calls us to his service. We offer ourselves so that through us, his Kingdom may be advanced in our homes, streets, and places of work and play.
