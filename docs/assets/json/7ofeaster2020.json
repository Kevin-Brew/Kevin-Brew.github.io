    "blurb": "In this sermon, Kevin discusses the feelings of losing control and transitioning from the old normal to the new normal during the COVID-19 lockdown. He draws parallels between the Apostles' transition period after Jesus' Ascension and the current situation. Kevin encourages embracing the new normal not only as a challenge but also as a stimulus to explore new ways of worship and community.",
    "raw_text": "We are now well into the business of 'lockdown'. Over the past couple of weeks I, for one, have found myself looking less at the news, I have absorbed the basic daily statistics and any changes being introduced by the government; but a weariness has crept in of absorbing more and more incidental details that do not directly impinge on me or my work. I have heard a range of reactions to this ongoing experience we are all sharing. Within a general feeling that the health authorities here have handled the overall situation well, I\u2019ve heard a number of different impressions. For some there is a feeling of security, that people are reluctant to move out of. For others there is a frustration, not directed at the authorities, that this seems to be endless, that they can\u2019t see an end to the threat posed by the virus, that we are stuck in a sort of limbo. Then, earlier in the week, someone told me; 'Kevin, I feel that I am losing control of my life. I\u2019m used to being in control, and I don\u2019t feel I am at the minute.' This person was talking about their own particular circumstances; but, as I thought about what that person said to me, I realised that these words could apply to all of us.\n\nAs a society we are conscious of a lack of control, of a desire to regain some sort of control that will enable business and social life to continue. We have heard a lot about the old normal we\u2019ve lost and the new normal that will greet us, as we emerge from the lock down.\n\nThis Sunday, the 7th Sunday of Easter, stands between the Feast of the Ascension and the Feast of Pentecost, the coming of the Holy Spirit on the Apostles. This period represents something of an in between phase for the followers of Jesus. They\u2019ve lost the familiar, the immediate presence of Jesus; they\u2019ve been told to wait, to stay in Jerusalem until they have received power form on high.\n\nSo as I say, we find them in a period of transition; transition form the old normal; a close association of hearing, touching, physical presence to one of apparent separation. In our lesson from Acts, in this final conversation with the risen Jesus, they try to understand this new normal in terms of the old; 'Lord is this the time when you will restore the Kingdom to Israel.' There will be a kingdom, but it will not be a kingdom as they have understood it in the past, based on territory and power. It will be one based on the teaching, the presence, the power of the crucified, risen, ascended and glorified Christ, advanced not through the might of armies but by the witness of his followers 'in Judea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth.'\n\nThen after he passes from their sight, they experience two men asking, 'Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up toward heaven?' They are not to look backwards, they are to look forwards, to the task, to the mission he has entrusted to them. And so we leave them, standing between the old normal, the familiar normal, and the new normal, that uncertain future that lies before them, waiting for the coming of the promised Holy Spirit.\n\nTo return to our own situation, as we begin the process of emerging from lockdown, as we move from the old normal of unfettered contact, unfettered movement, unfettered gathering towards the new normal, the uncertain, the anxious future.\n\nAs that person said to me during the week:\n\n'Kevin, I feel that I am losing control of my life. I\u2019m used to being in control, and I don\u2019t feel I am at the minute.'\n\nAnd as I said about ourselves:\n\nAs a society we are conscious of a lack of control, of a desire to regain some sort of control that will enable business and social life to continue.\n\nI suppose we begin by saying that we will do this together, as we have travelled through the lockdown together. We are beginning to think of how we as a Church as a worshipping community begin the process of emerging from lockdown. In the past we enjoyed the chat, the handshakes, the hugs as we gathered for worship, as we gathered for coffee in the hall afterwards, as we departed. We have valued the intimacy inherent in our celebration of the Holy Communion, the exchange of the peace (even if some didn\u2019t), the kneeling together at the rail, the drinking from the common cup.\n\nAs we move into the future we will follow public health advice, (to do otherwise would be highly irresponsible) and that will seriously impact these practices we have valued and which, in our isolation, we have missed. How do we do this without losing that sense of community, that sense of Common Prayer, as we gather for worship?\n\nWe will do that primarily in community, in communion with one another. We will do it in communion with the risen Christ who calls us as he called his first disciples; who is present with us as he promised to be present with them; who empowers us as he empowered them in the coming of the Holy Spirit.\n\nThe lock down forced us to explore different, unfamiliar ways of doing things. As a colleague down the country said to me; 'Isn\u2019t it amazing how much you can learn in half an hour, typing a series of \u2018How do you..?\u2019 questions into Google?'\n\nIn the process we have discovered the potential of YouTube, of Zoom and other online streaming platforms in reaching out not only to people who, before the lockdown, attended church on a regular basis \u2013 but also those confined to home, those who had simply dropped out of church life. These new ways will continue as part of Church life.\n\nAs we begin to make the move from old normal to new normal I would encourage us to see the new normal not only in terms of difficulty but also a stimulus to explore new ways of doing old things \u2013 that in us and through us God may continue to be worshipped; and in us and through us God\u2019s Kingdom continue to be advanced 'in all Judea and Samaria and to the ends of the earth.'",

    "summary": "From the sermon provided, here are the top 4 concepts:\n\n1. **Transition from Old Normal to New Normal**: The sermon discusses the shift from a familiar way of life to a new, uncertain future due to the pandemic lockdown, drawing parallels to the disciples' transition after Jesus' ascension.\n\n2. **Loss of Control and Desire to Regain It**: It touches on the feelings of losing control over one's life and the collective desire to regain some semblance of control to continue business and social life.\n\n3. **Community and Communion**: The importance of community and communion within the church is emphasized, even as traditional practices are impacted by public health advice.\n\n4. **Adaptation and Innovation**: The sermon encourages embracing new ways of doing things, such as using technology for worship and outreach, seeing this as an opportunity for growth and continuing the mission of the church.\n\nFor a non-religious black and white pencil diagram that can be represented graphically, the concept of \"Transition from Old Normal to New Normal\" seems most suitable. It is a universal experience not tied to any specific religion and can be represented in a variety of ways.\n\nHere is a detailed prompt for DALL-E 3 to create an image for the concept of \"Transition from Old Normal to New Normal\":\n\n\"Create a black and white pencil drawing that depicts a serene landscape divided by a meandering river.
