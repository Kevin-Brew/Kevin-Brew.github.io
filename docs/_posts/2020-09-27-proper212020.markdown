PROPER 21 – Year A – 2020 – Trinity 16

"Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus," Philippians 2:5

Kevin discusses the phenomenon of cult movies or TV series fans dressing up as their favorite characters, comparing this to Christians' call to imitate Christ. However, he clarifies that this imitation should go beyond mere external appearances to a transformation of the heart and mind.

Paul's 'Christ Hymn' in Philippians speaks of Christ's self-emptying love, and Kevin echoes this call for us to embody the same mindset. He warns against self-righteous legalism and instead promotes a conversion that affects every aspect of life.

Reflecting on St. Francis' words, Kevin emphasizes the importance of living out the Gospel in all life situations, especially during challenging times like the pandemic. He speaks to the need for hope and solidarity, and the simple acts of service we can offer to support one another.

Kevin concludes with the Prayer of St. Francis, which serves as a guide for bringing Christ's light and presence into dark and troubling times.
