    "blurb": "This sermon explores the transformation of Simon into Peter, as told in the Gospel of Mark. It uses the metaphor of an egg hatching into a swan to illustrate the potential for change and growth within each individual. The sermon emphasizes that God sees beyond our external appearances and values the inherent goodness within us.",
    "raw_text": "Epiphany 3 - 2012 \u2013 Year B - Family Eucharist\n\n'You are Simon \u2013 you will be called Peter.' This is from John\u2019s account of the calling of Simon that we read from Mark\u2019s Gospel. What was the difference between the Simon that Jesus first encountered and the Peter at the end of the story.\n\nTo set our thoughts on their way; take a look at this egg. If you were to find something like this in a nest (and you are never, ever to take a egg out of a nest), what do you think would be inside it? Let us have a look at this short video clip.\n\nShow video of hatching swan\n\nI am now just going to ask a couple of people a question so could I have a couple of volunteers:\n\nAsk each of them what they want to be when they are older\n\nDo they now look like a \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n\nMaybe not \u2013 but there is a \u2026\u2026\u2026. lurking inside them waiting to come out\n\nDoes anyone remember their Baptism? (Someone may say yes)\n\nAt your Baptism, either Canon Hyland or myself will have said this prayer for you as your parents and godparents stood around this font holding you in their arms:\n\nMay almighty God deliver you from the powers of darkness,\nrestore in you the image of his glory,\nand lead you in the light and obedience of Christ. Amen.\n\nThere is something special about each one of you \u2013 I am not talking about the fact you are pretty, or clever, or good at sport. The Bible says that we are all made in the image of God \u2013 what that is saying is that there is a bit of God in each one of us \u2013 we can hide it at times selfishness, pride, greed \u2013 but that bit of God is still there - and God sees it.\n\nWhen Samuel was choosing a new King of Israel from among the sons of Jesse he was going to go for the tallest, the strongest but, in the story in the Old Testament, he hears God saying to him, \u2018Man looks at the outside \u2013 God looks at the heart.\u2019\n\nIn our Old Testament Lesson we have the story of Jonah preaching to the people of Nineveh. Nineveh was a pretty grim place \u2013 in truth Jonah probably liked the idea of God punishing them. The story tells us that Nineveh had a change of heart and they were not punished \u2013 God saw beyond the disobedience to something that was good. Jonah was confused, even angry with God.\n\nAs Simon came towards Jesus that day, other people would have seen a big fisherman, not the most important on the social scale of that day, probably a rough manner and accent. But Jesus looked beyond that \u2013 he saw the Peter inside, the Peter he knew he could be, would be. The rest of Simon\u2019s life was a process of changing from the Simon he was into the Peter God intended him to be.\n\nThere is something special to God about each person here. A big part of the Christian life is discovering that, building on that, becoming the person God wants us to be.",
