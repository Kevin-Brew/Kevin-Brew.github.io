God has delivered us from the dominion of darkness and has given us a place with the saints in light. The newly baptized are sent out with these words: You have received the light of Christ; walk in this light all the days of your life. Shine as a light in the world to the glory of God the Father.

Isaiah 60:1, "Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the LORD rises upon you."

After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem and asked, "Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."
