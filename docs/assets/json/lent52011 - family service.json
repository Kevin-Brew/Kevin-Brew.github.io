    "blurb": "This sermon uses the story of Apollo 13 to illustrate the importance of understanding the whole story of Easter. It emphasizes that to fully appreciate the wonder of resurrection, we need to know the reality of the Cross. The sermon concludes with a reminder of God's love for us, demonstrated through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.",
    "raw_text": "Apollo 13 \u2013 Telling the whole story\n\nWe tell someone tells us about something that happened and they say, \u2018Ah, but wait. You haven't heard the whole story.\u2019 We hear bits about what happened. Story of Apollo 13, story of one of the early trips to the moon that went badly wrong but the crew got back safely in the end. It all started very well. People had almost got bored with these trips to the moon \u2013 it was no longer main item on the news. Then disaster struck \u2013 one of the oxygen tanks exploded \u2013 Major damage to the space craft - power reduced \u2013 oxygen supplies reduced \u2013 looked for a while that the crew were not going to be able to make it back \u2013 prayer vigil in St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and in city\u2019s around the world. They made it back and landed safely. Crew recovered.\n\nWe could look at that last picture and say \u2018They landed safely\u2019 but it is only if we know the rest of that story that we can realise how amazing that safe landing was.\n\nWe are about to celebrate Easter. Next Sunday, Palm Sunday, we will read about the entry of Jesus into Jerusalem. On Easter morning we will read about the disciples finding the tomb empty. But we very rarely hear in Church (unless you go to one of the Holy Week Services) the rest of the story, the bit that happens in between. We need to know the reality of the Cross to appreciate the wonder of resurrection. In the light of the resurrection we see the cross as God\u2019s victory over death.\n\nAs we approach Easter, this is what the Sunday School have done for us today \u2013 they have helped us to hear the whole story, the story of God\u2019s love for us in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus.",
