    "blurb": "This sermon explores the concept of prayer as a form of communication and encounter with God. It discusses how prayer can be a source of comfort and understanding during times of despair and hardship. The sermon also emphasizes the importance of honesty and openness in prayer, and the transformative power it can have on individuals and communities.",
    "raw_text": "Last week, if you recall, our Old Testament Lesson was the story of Elijah hiding in the cave on the slopes of Mount Horeb, on the run from Jezebel, in fear for his life, feeling very vulnerable, desperately alone, at a very low ebb both mentally and spiritually. In the course of my reflections I spoke of a book I was reading by Richard Holloway, former Primus of the Church of Scotland, in which he spoke of a time in his ministry when God went absent. In this period in his life prayer, worship, ministry seemed empty.\n\nThis morning, at the 11:00 o\u2019clock service, we are using the form of worship for the Service of Wholeness and Healing. This brings together both sickness and prayer. Illness, particularly a serious illness either in ourselves or one close to us, can be a time when God seems to go absent. I recall a time in my own life, as I approached my ordination and my mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer. I recall anger, despair, God not seeming to be around when I wanted him the most. It was, as it turned out, at that particular time that Canon John Bartlett was giving a series of lectures on the Psalms and I found in them, quite literally, a spiritual lifeline.\n\nIn the Psalms I discovered a total openness, a total honesty with God. When the Psalmist expresses joy he does so with great expression, with timbrels, in dances, with trumpets and tambourines, in extravagant and exuberant tones. When he is in despair his expressions of gloom and hopelessness are stark. When he feels God has let him down, as the evil seem to triumph over the righteous, he demands to know why. His hopes for vengeance can be expressed in quite blood curdling tones as he expresses hopes of dashing his enemy\u2019s children against the rocks. In the psalms I discovered I could be totally open with God. I could praise, I could question, I could complain, I could celebrate, I could express pain and despair \u2013 and know that I am heard. In a word, there is communication. And so in the opening verses of the Psalm appointed for today the Psalmist proclaims:\n\n1 I cry a|loud to | God; @\nI cry aloud to | God and | he will | hear me.\n2 In the day of my trouble I have | sought the | Lord; @\nby night my hand is stretched out and does not tire;\nmy | soul re|fuses | comfort. (Ps 72:1-2)\n\nWhich brings me into the subject of prayer. What are we doing when we pray? Are we trying to change God or change ourselves? We pray for peace in the world, we pray for the sick, we pray for those on the margins of our society, we pray for those who mourn. I recall when I was in Northern Ireland, as the peace process began, resolving in my own mind to pray on a regular basis for the various political leaders by name \u2013 and for some considerable time the names Adams, McGuinness, Paisley, Irvine stuck in my throat. Did they change; did I change \u2013 but there is no doubt that Northern Ireland, for all its continuing tensions, is a very different place \u2013 people changed and entered into dialogues previously thought unthinkable.\n\nWhat are we doing when we pray for the sick? I recall discussing this with a colleague in Ballymena who was involved in the ministry of healing. He described it as \u2018messy\u2019 with lots of loose ends and unanswered questions \u2013 yet he felt compelled to continue praying for the sick \u2013 it was the right thing for him to do and situations changed in ways he could not expect or understand.\n\nI would often find that hymns, with their poetry and economy of language can express things almost too deep for words. As I thought over things my mind turned to a hymn in our book I have rarely heard sung but one I would reflect on. It is hymn 625 in our book, written by the Moravian hymn writer James Montergomery:\n\nPrayer is the soul's sincere desire,\nUttered or unexpressed, \u2026\u2026\u2026\nPrayer is the burden of a sigh,\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\nWhen none but God is near.\nPrayer is the simplest form of speech\nThat infant lips can try;\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\nPrayer is the Christian's vital breath,\nThe Christian's native air,\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\nO Christ by whom we come to God,\nThe Life, the Truth, the Way!\nThe humble path of prayer you trod:\nLord, teach us how to pray!\n\nI spoke of prayer as communication. I would now go one stage further and think of prayer as encounter, of engaging with God. Now again, is this just a matter of drawing God\u2019s attention to things he may or may not have noticed? We pray, we ask. If you look at the way that word ask is used in the New Testament, we have ask in terms of demand, of interrogation \u2013 but the most common use is in terms of enquire, translating the Greek word we have prayer as a seeking to understand. In St John\u2019s Gospel, in the account of the teaching of Jesus at the Last Supper, we have a number of instances of Jesus speaking of what it means to ask of God in prayer.\n\n14 If in my name you ask me for anything, I will do it. John 14:14\n7 If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask for whatever you wish, and it will be done for you John 15:7\n16 You did not choose me but I chose you. And I appointed you to go and bear fruit, fruit that will last, so that the Father will give you whatever you ask him in my name. John 15:16\n\nAsking in the name of Christ, abiding in Christ, chosen by Christ, we are drawn into a deeper relationship, a deeper understanding of God as personal; a God who hears, understands, who meets me at my point of deepest need. Prayer as communication, as encounter, is not something we witness but rather something we participate in from deep within ourselves. To go back to our hymn:\n\nPrayer is the soul's sincere desire,\nUttered or unexpressed, \u2026\u2026\u2026\nPrayer is the burden of a sigh,\nWhen none but God is near.\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\nPrayer is the Christian's vital breath,\nThe Christian's native air,\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\nO Christ by whom we come to God,\nThe Life, the Truth, the Way!\nThe humble path of prayer you trod:\nLord, teach us how to pray!",

    "summary": "From the sermon provided, the top four concepts that can be extracted are:\n\n1. The experience of spiritual desolation and the feeling of God's absence during times of personal crisis, as exemplified by Elijah's story and the speaker's own experience during their mother's illness.\n2. The therapeutic and cathartic power of the Psalms, which provide a means for honest and open communication with God, encompassing the full range of human emotions from joy to despair.\n3. The nature and purpose of prayer, which is depicted not just as a request for intervention but also as a form of communication, an encounter with God, and a means to change oneself and understand deeper truths.\n4. The transformative effect of persistent prayer on both the individual and the community, as illustrated by the prayers for political leaders in Northern Ireland and the reflections on the ministry of healing.\n\nFor a non-religious black and white pencil diagram that can be generated by DALL-E 3, the concept of the therapeutic and cathartic power of the Psalms seems the most suitable. It is a concept that can be represented abstractly and without specific religious imagery.\n\nHere is a detailed prompt for DALL-E 3 to create an image for that concept:\n\n\"Create a black and white pencil sketch that abstractly represents the therapeutic and cathartic power of emotional expression through art.
