    "raw_text": "PROPER 10 \u2013 Year A \u2013 2020 \u2013 Trinity 5\n\nAs you are by now well aware, my gardening skills are somewhat limited. The one aspect of gardening that does give me pleasure is vegetable gardening \u2013 not that I am very good at it but I do get a thrill out of eating my own rhubarb, salads, peas, beans and, even one year, the odd carrot. So when we moved into the current Rectory just over ten years ago, I set to work on an area at the end of the back garden that had been separated off as a vegetable patch.\n\nBack in those days the soil was quite a heavy clay, which meant it was hard to dig, hard to drain. Over the years of digging, weeding out roots of briar, scutch grass, bind weed, nettles and other undesirables, putting in garden and kitchen compost as well as manure the soil has now broken down and become much easier to work and more productive.\n\nThis morning we read as our Gospel reading the parable of the sower. It is one of those parables that would have spoken into the lives and experiences of his hearers. If they weren\u2019t farmers themselves the farmer sowing his seed would have been a familiar sight. We all know (at least I certainly do) of seeds that do and seeds that don\u2019t strike root and produce.\n\nAs Jesus tells the story, and enlarges on it later to the disciples, the story addresses the age old problem of why some people respond to Jesus\u2019 teaching and some do not. The temptation is for us who are more confident in our faith to look down on those who aren\u2019t, or those who have fallen away.\n\nThe parable itself ends with, 'Let anyone with ears, listen.' But then later on, when he is just with the disciples, Jesus says, 'Hear then the parable of the sower.' He puts the matter directly to them; 'How are you hearing this?' Not why aren\u2019t others but how are you hearing this?\n\nThat puts the question back on me. How do I hear? What sort of soil am I in which God can plant his seed? Does my hearing lead to an understanding of what Jesus is talking about? I go back to my vegetable garden. Over the years I have had to work at the soil in that patch of ground, to make it more productive, more receptive to the seeds, to the seedlings I plant in it.\n\nIn my own following of Jesus, I must be prepared to do a bit of cultivation myself \u2013 setting aside some of that most precious commodity, our time. Time to be quiet, time to be still. I\u2019m not talking of elaborate spiritual exercises \u2013 just finding space, finding time to be still.\n\nMaybe something that has come out of this prolonged period of lock down, of enforced inactivity, is that we have learned we don\u2019t have to rush all the time, we don\u2019t have to fill every moment of the day with activity \u2013 there is a time to rest, to reflect, to pray, to give God the soil in which to plant his seed.\n\nI know that we have only just started into the season of Trinity. On the Sunday on which this season ends we have that lovely Collect associated with Bible Sunday:\n\n> Blessed Lord,\n> who caused all holy Scriptures to be written for our learning:\n> help us so to hear them,\n> to read, mark, learn and inwardly digest them\n> that, through patience, and the comfort of your holy word,\n> we may embrace and for ever hold fast\n> the hope of everlasting life,\n> which you have given us in our Saviour Jesus Christ.\n\nI love the way in which those words roll off the tongue:- help us so to hear them, to read, mark, learn and inwardly digest them that, through patience, and the comfort of your holy word, we may embrace and for ever hold fast the hope of everlasting life.\n\nTake time, to reflect, to savour, to absorb.\n\nReturning to the parable, there is the final outcome of the harvest, 100 fold, 60 fold, 30 fold. The farmer of those days would have felt he was doing well if he got a harvest that was 7 or 10 fold. So, the final scene is not of birds snatching away seed on the path, rootless plants from seeds falling among the rocks, withering in the scorching sun, spindly stalks smothered by weeds but of a rich bountiful harvest. To the original disciples who were so few among so many, Matthew\u2019s community dwarfed by its surroundings, the final scene is an encouragement to great confidence in God\u2019s purposes. Though their numbers are small, the opposition hard to take, the rejections of their message painful, the remarkable size of the harvest is a reminder of the riches of God\u2019s blessing.\n\nThe writer of the Letter of James tells us: 'Draw near to God and he will draw near to you.' James 4:8. Spend time in his presence and God will take what we have to offer and work in it and through it. I recall as a young curate talking to the late Canon Billy Wynne. Billy had just gone to St Ann\u2019s and had started their daily lunchtime communion services. I asked him how many he was getting. I have never forgotten his reply. 'Brew,' he said, with a patient smile on his face, 'I will plant the seed \u2013 God will give the increase.' And a ministry started that continues to this day.",
