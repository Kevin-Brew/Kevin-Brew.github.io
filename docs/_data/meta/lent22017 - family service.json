He reflects on the importance of personal relationships with God, symbolized by the prayer of Confirmation. The sermon also touches on understanding Jesus as a teacher, friend, and healer, and the transformative power of the cross.",
    "raw_text": "LENT 2 \u2013 2017 \u2013 Year A\nFamily Service\n\nWe've just heard that conversation between Jesus and Nicodemus. There was talk of the Spirit. I thought of the prayer that Archbishop Jackson is going to say over each of our Confirmation candidates at the end of April. Confirm, O Lord, your servant...\n\nTalking to our Confirmation candidates \u2013 rest of you can listen in. What is the Archbishop, what are the rest of us asking for in that prayer of Confirmation? Gospel talks of being born again, born from above \u2013 Lots of adults have problems getting their heads around that one.\n\nLet's go back to the very start. The day you were born is special, we celebrate it. For your Mum, that was a day in a lifetime \u2013 that was the day she gave birth to you. Not just special to Mum \u2013 you are special to God.\n\nBeen thinking a lot about that in our Confirmation classes. God making the world, God making us, making us in his image. Not as if God made us and then gets bored with us. God wants a relationship with us. Can only have a relationship with someone you know. We thought of ways in which God shows himself \u2013 in creation, in other people.\n\nWe thought about Jesus, what he means to us. We used the expression 'Jesus \u2013 God's way of showing us what God is like'. We thought about Jesus as teacher, as friend, as healer. We thought about the cross \u2013 what does it mean to say Jesus dies for us \u2013 what does it mean to say the cross breaks the power of sin \u2013 remember the exercise we did \u2013 we wrote some regret on a piece of paper \u2013 no-one else saw it \u2013 and we burned it.\n\nIn his time with the disciples, Jesus spoke of sending the Holy Spirit, a comforter, a guide.\n\nHoly Spirit \u2013 God's way of being with us. Going back to our Gospel \u2013 Jesus and Nicodemus. Jesus talks of wind \u2013 where does it come from, where is it going. Anyone who sails or windsurfs knows the importance of that. When I have been out on a boat, I am always struck by the way a sailor keeps a constant eye on the wind. Misjudge the strength or direction of the wind, lose speed, capsize, or other horrible things.\n\nWhat Jesus is saying is that we need to be prepared to watch out for the Spirit, to listen, and just be still. That will lead us into prayer \u2013 that is the next stage of our journey towards confirmation.",
