    "blurb": "Kevin reflects on the journey of faith as a path guided by God's presence, drawing parallels between the Israelites' journey from Mount Sinai and our own spiritual journey. He emphasizes the importance of God's grace and the Holy Spirit in overcoming challenges and growing in likeness to Jesus Christ. The sermon encourages believers to be living signs of God's kingdom, embodying hope and purpose in the world.",
    "raw_text": "Proper 24 \u2013 2011 \u2013 year A \u2013 Trinity 21\n\nI remember a few years ago sitting with a lady in hospital drawing close to the end of a long battle with cancer over a period of 20 years. Liz had maintained a wonderful, yet deeply rooted, positivity over that period. We chatted over lots of things, her family, the ups and downs of her battle with cancer and we almost drifted into the whole issue of faith. I asked her, \u201cYou do know that God loves you, don\u2019t you?\u201d She smiled and said, \u201cIf I had not known that I would not have been able to cope.\u201d\n\nShe had a sense of God\u2019s presence with her at every stage of her journey \u2013 even when that presence seemed remote \u2013 even when she found it hard to pray. In our Old Testament Lesson we read of the people of Israel preparing to move on from Mount Sinai. The preceding sections of this Book Exodus have told of the highs and the lows, the giving of the Law and the incident of the Golden Calf. In this particular passage, Moses is wrestling with the enormity of the task that God has laid upon him. He hears God\u2019s promise that his presence will go with him. To which Moses comes back with a reply that could be summarised by, \u201cIf you are not going to be with us, I do not even want to start.\u201d\n\nWe are talking here of setting out on a journey, a journey home. Not that they had even lived there \u2013 it was a place where they belonged as a people, a land promised to their ancestors. It was to be a journey fraught with danger and difficulty. The account of this journey that we have in Exodus has its highs and lows, its moments of great faithfulness, its moments of abject failure. But all through this journey, God is with them \u2013 the pillar of cloud, the provision of manna.\n\nWe too are on a journey; at one level a journey from life to death; on the level of faith a journey into life. I think of the words of Hymn 1, a chant from the Taize community:\n\n> Bless the Lord my soul, and bless God\u2019s holy name.\n> Bless the Lord my soul, who leads me into life.\n\nLike Moses in our Lesson, we seek God\u2019s presence with us on this journey of a lifetime, this journey home. As I think of God\u2019s presence with us on our journey, two expressions, two categories of God\u2019s presence with us come to mind; those of grace and the Holy Spirit. As I reflected on this I turned to the Revised Catechism. On the issue of grace it asks the question, in the context of keeping the commandments:\n\n\u201cHow can you carry out these duties and overcome temptation and sin?\u201d\n\u201cI can do these things only by the help of God through his grace.\u201d\n\nThis is followed by the question:\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean by God\u2019s grace?\u201d\n\u201cBy God\u2019s grace I mean that God himself acts in Jesus Christ to forgive, inspire, and strengthen me by his Holy Spirit.\u201d\n\nGod forgiving me, inspiring me, strengthening me.\n\nTurning to the question on the Holy Spirit:\n\n\u201cThe Church teaches that God the Holy Spirit inspires all that is good in humanity; that he came in his fullness at Pentecost to be the giver of life to the Church, and that he enables me to grow in likeness to Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\nInspires all that is good; enables me to grow in likeness to Jesus Christ.\n\nJust continuing our thoughts of life as a journey in the presence of God, a God who forgives, who inspires, who strengthens, who enables me to grow in likeness to Jesus Christ; I am called not just to travel but to travel with a purpose. The writer of Genesis tells us that when God called Abram, he called him with a purpose. \u201cI will make of you a great nation \u2026 I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing \u2026 in you all the families of the earth will be blessed.\u201d (Gen 12:2-3) The nation was called not just for its own sake but that it might be a sign, an instrument of blessing on the wider world.\n\nIn teaching his own disciples, he called them to be signs. \u2018You are the salt of the earth \u2026 you are the light of the world \u2026 let your light shine before others that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven.\u2019 (Matt 5:13,14,16).\n\nWe are called to travel the journey of life with a purpose, to be signs of the Kingdom, to be beacons of hope in the world in which we live. And so in the post communion prayer set for today, as we give thanks for God giving us \u201cevery good and perfect gift\u201d we pray that we may \u201cbe a living sign of that perfect kingdom, where your whole creation will be made perfect in Jesus Christ our Lord.\u201d\n\nAnd so, as we prepare to go back out into the world, to continue our journey before God, we join in praying:\n\nAlmighty God,\nwe thank you for feeding us\nwith the spiritual food\nof the body and blood of your Son Jesus Christ.\nThrough him we offer you our souls and bodies\nto be a living sacrifice.\nSend us out in the power of your Spirit\nto live and work to your praise and glory. Amen.",
