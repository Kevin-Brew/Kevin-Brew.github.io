    "blurb": "This sermon reflects on the events of Palm Sunday and Holy Week, drawing parallels between the historical events and our modern lives. It emphasizes the importance of selflessness and love, as exemplified by Jesus. The sermon also discusses the power of the word 'I' and how it can be used both positively and negatively, urging us to 'cross out' the 'I' in our lives, symbolizing selflessness and humility.",
    "raw_text": "Last Tuesday morning I called down for a special event in the Burrow School. It was Proclamation Day \u2013 in common with Schools across the country they had a simple ceremony of raising the flag, singing the National Anthem and a reading of the 1916 Proclamation. Then members of 6th Class read out their 2016 Proclamation, their own vision of the Ireland they will live and work in \u2013 there were wonderful themes of inclusion, of respect, of pride in their country. So it was a time of remembering events that lie at the core of the foundation of the State and a vision of the Ireland they would like to see.\n\nThis coming week is Holy Week. It is a week in which we remember events at the very core of our faith \u2013 the death and resurrection of Jesus. Jerusalem at the time of Jesus was firmly under Roman rule. People looking for a leader, a Messiah, a liberator. When Jesus was cheered as he entered Jerusalem, he was welcomed as a hero \u2013 could this be the Messiah, could this be the liberator? Less than a week later he was jeered as he was lead out of the city to be crucified.\n\nWhy did the cheers turn to jeers? What was it about Jesus that people found so threatening, so upsetting?\n\nI\u2019m going to start by thinking of the letter \u2018I\u2019 We use this letter a lot. We use to express opinions \u2013 \u2018I think Howth is great\u2019 We use it to express our affection \u2013 we say \u2018I love you\u2019 We use it to encourage other people \u2013 \u2018I think you are looking great today\u2019; \u2018I think you are really good at doing that\u2019. But \u2018I\u2019 is not always so pleasant. We can use it to express prejudice \u2013 \u2018I think foreigners are lazy, or stupid, or dishonest.\u2019 We can use it to express hatred \u2013 \u2018I hate you.\u2019; \u2018I despise you.\u2019 We can use it to undermine people \u2013 \u2018I think you are stupid.\u2019; \u2018I think you are ugly.\u2019\n\nSo the letter \u2018I\u2019 needs to be controlled a bit. In fact sometimes I need to cross the letter \u2018I\u2019 out. (Put cross bar in place and hold up) Now what do I get? That\u2019s right a cross \u2013 the cross is, if you like, the letter \u2018I\u2019 crossed out. \u2018I\u2019 crossed out in many ways describes not just the death of Jesus but the whole of his life. That is summed beautifully in those words Paul wrote to the Church at Philippi. I am going to read it from the translation, \u2018The Message\u2019.\n\n> Phil2:5-8 Think of yourselves the way Christ Jesus thought of himself. He had equal status with God but didn\u2019t think so much of himself that he had to cling to the advantages of that status no matter what. Not at all. When the time came, he set aside the privileges of deity and took on the status of a slave, became human! Having become human, he stayed human. It was an incredibly humbling process. He didn\u2019t claim special privileges. Instead, he lived a selfless, obedient life and then died a selfless, obedient death\u2014and the worst kind of death at that\u2014a crucifixion.\n\nOn one occasion Jesus told his followers, \u201cIf any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me.\u201d What does that mean - taking up our cross daily?\n\nWe find our example in the life of Jesus, life lived with the \u2018I\u2019 crossed out. People found that threatening, because it meant they had to change the way they looked at themselves, at God, at other people. The cross, God\u2019s amazing love for us in Jesus, happened in the past - but it is not just about the past, it is about life now. A life in which I encourage people rather than undermine them; in which I express love and not hatred, in which we turn our back on prejudice and instead honour one another.\n\nI will just close with the prayer of St Ignatius which I think gives us a lovely pattern for living in the footsteps of Jesus.\n\n> Teach us, good Lord, to serve thee as thou deservest;\n> To give, and not to count the cost,\n> to fight, and not to heed the wounds,\n> to toil, and not to seek for rest,\n> to labor, and not to ask for any reward,\n> save that of knowing that we do thy will.",
