PROPER 13 – Year A – 2020 – Trinity 8

Kevin recalls his early ministry days and a story from a New York Rector who revitalized a dwindling parish near Wall Street through a weekday ministry offering affordable lunches. This small act of service breathed new life into the church.

Reflecting on the Gospel reading, Kevin focuses on the feeding of the five thousand and the disciples' initial hesitation to address the crowd's hunger. He highlights the importance of using available resources, no matter how small, to serve others.

> Matt 14:15-17
> 'We have nothing here but five loaves and two fish.'

The sermon continues to explore biblical examples of God working through the weak and insignificant, culminating in the Incarnation. Kevin speaks of God's love and grace, asking for our own love and service in return, no matter how tentative or imperfect.

In conclusion, Kevin invites us to find the meaning of grace and to trust that our small offerings can be used by God to create significant change, echoing his adoration for Jesus and the call to love more deeply.
