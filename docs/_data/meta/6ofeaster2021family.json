    "blurb": "In this sermon, Kevin reflects on the significance of being chosen by God, drawing from his personal experience of confirmation. He emphasizes that everyone is special in God's eyes, not because of their abilities or appearance, but because God has chosen them. He also highlights that we are put in this world to make a difference and bear fruit, using examples of influential figures who have made significant changes rooted in their Christian faith.",
    "raw_text": "One of my memories of School is of choosing of teams. Two people are picked as captains and then they take turns in picking their team from the rest of the class. They obviously pick the ones who are best at running, at catching a ball or whatever.\n\nNow I wasn\u2019t great at sport so I tended to be among the last to be picked. That came to mind as I read our lesson for today as Jesus told his disciples; \u2018You did not choose me, I chose you and appointed you.\u2019\n\nThat verse has always been important to me as that was the text chosen by the Bishop of Aston when I was confirmed \u2013 I wasn\u2019t confirmed until I was 17. That is a memory that has stayed with me. At the minute our young people are meeting up over Zoom for our current set of confirmation classes.\n\nUnfortunately we don\u2019t know yet when your Confirmation will take place \u2013 but I hope it will be a special day for you as it was for me. As for the rest of you; do you remember your own confirmation? The day of taking for ourselves the promises of Baptism.\n\nI certainly remember mine and I remember the text the Bishop chose \u2013 don\u2019t remember much of what he said but the text and I suppose how he said it has stayed with me.\n\n\u2018You did not choose me, I chose you and appointed you.\u2019\n\nOr in the Message translation that we read from \u201cYou didn\u2019t choose me, remember; I chose you, and put you in the world to bear fruit.\u201d\n\nI take two very important lessons from that. The first is that each one of you, each person is special. You didn\u2019t choose me \u2013 I chose you. Special not because we are the best runners, the best person at maths or science or Irish or geography or history, the prettiest or the most handsome- we are all special because God has decided that we are special; he has placed a supreme value on each one of us, the life, the death, the resurrection of Jesus \u2013 God says to each one of us \u2013 \u2018You\u2019re worth that to me.\u2019 \u2013 the rest of my life, of your life is one of learning what that means to each one of us.\n\nThe next lesson I take is that we are put here to make a difference. \u2018remember; I chose you, and put you in the world to bear fruit.\u2019 Over the period of a confirmation course we think of what we believe about God, about Jesus. We also think of how that makes a difference in how we look at a whole lot of other things. The other night we were thinking about the environment, how we are to look after this beautiful world. Emma came from Tearfund and got us to think about our responsibilities to other people; the problems faced by refugees, how we should respond to that.\n\nPeople of faith can make a difference in the world. I think of people who have campaigned against racism and oppression, their message was rooted in their deep Christian conviction that racism and oppression was an offence before God \u2013 I think of Martin Luther King in America, Desmond Tutu in South Africa who changed their countries \u2013 all out of a deeply held Christian faith. They were people who made a difference.\n\nHow can you or I bring something of God\u2019s love, God\u2019s desire for justice, for peace building, for reconciliation in my school, my place of work, my home, my community.\n\n\u2018You did not choose me, I chose you and appointed you.\u2019\n\nThat stayed with me from the night of my Confirmation. May each one of you grow in your understanding of God\u2019s love for you and your place in his Church \u2013 and may God work in and through each one of you in what ever you do, wherever you live, whoever you marry.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t choose me, remember; I chose you, and put you in the world to bear fruit.",

    "prompt": "Create a black and white pencil-drawn diagram showing a diverse array of trees, each with different fruits hanging from their branches, set in a serene garden. Each tree should be unique, symbolizing individuality, with roots visibly intertwined beneath the soil, representing interconnectedness and unity. In the center, a large tree with branches extending outward, supporting a variety of bird nests, each with a bird caring for its eggs or feeding its chicks, to symbolize nurturing and the bearing of fruit in a metaphorical sense. The garden should be teeming with life, including bees pollinating flowers, a squirrel gathering nuts, and a small stream flowing through, nurturing the garden, to illustrate the concept of creating a positive impact and contributing to the flourishing of the community. No human figures, religious symbols, or text should be included in the image.",
    "summary": "Based on the sermon provided, here are the top 4 concepts:\n\n1. **Divine Selection and Appointment**: The recurring theme of Jesus choosing his disciples, emphasizing that individuals are chosen for a purpose, reflecting the idea that God selects each person for a special role, regardless of their worldly abilities or status.\n\n2. **Personal Value and Worth**: The sermon stresses that each person is special not because of their abilities or appearance, but because God has placed a supreme value on each one, symbolized by the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.\n\n3. **Purpose and Fruitfulness**: The concept of being chosen to \"bear fruit\" in the world, which translates to making a positive difference in various aspects of life, including environmental stewardship and social responsibilities.\n\n4. **Influence and Social Justice**: The call for people of faith to act against racism and oppression, inspired by figures like Martin Luther King and Desmond Tutu, and to bring God's love, justice, peace building, and reconciliation into their communities.\n\nFor a non-religious black and white pencil diagram that can be represented graphically without text, the concept of \"Purpose and Fruitfulness\" seems most suitable, as it can be depicted through a variety of universal symbols and scenarios without explicit religious imagery.\n\n**Detailed Prompt for DALL-E 3:**\n\n\"Create a black and white pencil-drawn diagram showing a diverse array of trees, each with different fruits hanging from their branches, set in a serene garden.
