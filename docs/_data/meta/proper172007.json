    "blurb": "In this sermon, Kevin reflects on the profound contrast between the joy of his son's wedding and the somber visit to Auschwitz. He explores the crisis of faith faced by many during the Holocaust and the enduring message of hope found in the Epistle to the Hebrews. Kevin emphasizes the presence of God in both joy and suffering, and the moral choices that define our humanity.",
    "raw_text": "Proper 17 \u2013 2007 \u2013 year C \u2013 Trinity 13\n\nLast weekend we celebrated one of the joys of family life, the marriage of our elder son Anthony. His bride being Polish, the wedding took place in Poland, in the historic city of Krakow. It was a great joy to be able to conduct the ceremony myself in the Lutheran Church of St Martin using the liturgy of the Church of Ireland in a mixture of English and Polish. Krakow, with the royal castle of Wavel, many beautiful Churches and a magnificent Main Square bustling with life at all hours of the day and night, is a beautiful city, listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. As with any such place, there were many trips on offer to different places of interest.\n\nOne such trip was to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Situated just over an hour\u2019s journey from Krakow, it is of course synonymous with unspeakable brutality, human suffering and degradation. So last Monday morning we set off on our visit. I had taken a copy of this Sunday\u2019s lessons with me to glance over during the week; the verse that had caught my attention was from our Epistle:\n\n> 'God has said,\n> \"Never will I leave you;\n> never will I forsake you.\"\n> So we say with confidence,\n> \"The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid.\n> What can man do to me?\"' (Hebrews 13)\n\nThose words kept recurring in my mind as I listened to our tour guide speak of the horror of Auschwitz and the other death camps in which 6 million Jews, millions of Poles, as well as countless Slavs, handicapped, resistance fighters and others were disposed of on an industrial scale.\n\nThe words from the Epistle to the Hebrews seem to fly in the face of the awful reality of that awful place. When I came back, I picked up a passage I had read some years ago. It is a section in a book by Jonathan Sacks, the Chief Rabbi of the British Commonwealth, 'Faith in the Future', I have referred to before. The section is entitled 'On God and Auschwitz' that first appeared in the form of a talk on BBC Radio 4.\n\n[...]\n\nAs I wandered around Auschwitz with those words in my mind, I was confronted with two realities. First, there is a dark side to human nature. Secondly, the reality, the responsibility of moral choice. Man is created free; free to go with God, free to go against God. Take away that freedom and moral choice is an illusion. But with moral choice comes awful possibilities when the darker side of human nature comes to the fore.\n\nI come to see God, not as one who insulates us from all pain but as one who is with his people in the midst of their trouble, their anguish and their suffering. God did not die at Auschwitz; He wept tears for his people as they blessed his name at the gates of death. This I think is why I found the cross so powerful. In that anguished cry of despair, 'My God, my God. Why have you abandoned me?' I find in Christ a God who has entered into human suffering, who understands the loneliness and despair and emerged triumphant \u2013 and is present with us now through his Spirit.\n\nThe images of Auschwitz will remain with me probably as long as those of my son and my daughter-in-law standing before me in St Martin\u2019s in Krakow as I declared them to be husband and wife. I realize, as I reflect on those two images, that the God who shared in my joy last weekend is the same God who remains with me and sustains me in the ups and downs of this mortal life. So I think I can begin to understand what the writer of the Letter to the Hebrews was getting at as he wrote:\n\n> 'God has said,\n> \"Never will I leave you;\n> never will I forsake you.\"\n> So we say with confidence,\n> \"The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid.\n> What can man do to me?\"'",

His bride being Polish, the wedding took place in Poland, in the historic city of\nKrakow. It was a great joy to be able to conduct the ceremony myself in the Lutheran\nChurch of St Martin using the liturgy of the Church of Ireland in a mixture of English and\nPolish. Krakow, with the royal castel of Wavel, many beautiful Churches and a\nmagnificent Main Square bustling with life at all hours of the day and night, is a beautiful\ncity, liszted as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. As with any such place there were any\nnumber of trips on offer to different places of interest.\nOne such trip was to Aushwitz-Birkenau. Situated just over an hour\u2019s journey from\nKrakow, it is of course synonymous with unspeakable brutality, human suffering and\ndegradation. So last Monday morning we set off on our visit. I had taken a copy of this\nSunday\u2019s lessons with me to glance over during the week; the verse that had caught my\nattention was the verse our of our Epistle:\n\u2018God has said,\n\u201cNever will I leave you;\nnever will I forsake you.\u201d\nSo we say with confidence,\n\u201cThe Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid.\nWhat can man do to me?\u201d\u2019 (Hebrews 13)\nThose words kept recurring in my mind as I listened to our tour guide speak of the horror\nof Aushchwitz and the other death camps in which 6 million Jews (one third of all\nEuropean Jewry), millions of Poles (both Jew and Gentile) as well as countless Slavs,\nhandicapped, resistance fighters and others were disposed with on an industrial scale.\nThose words from the Epistle to the Hebrews seem to fly in the face of the aweful reality\nof that aweful place. When I came back I picked up a passage I had read some years ago.\nIt is a section in a book by Jonathan Sacks, the Chief Rabbi of the British Commonwealth,\n\u2018Faith in the Future\u2019, I have referred to before. The section is entitled \u2018On God and\nAuschwitz\u2019 that first appeared in the form of a talk on BBC Radio 4.\nPage 2 of 3\nProper 17 \u2013 2007 \u2013 year C \u2013 Trinity 13\nIn thids passage he refers to the aweful crisis of faith that the Holocaust, the Shoah,\nrepresented for the Jewish people. Jewish spirituality was familiar with the concept of\nGod distancing himself from his people in the face of their disobedience \u2013 but nothing, not\neven the destruction of the Temple, cmae close to these horrendous events. There was that\nheart rending question, \u2018Where was God at Auschwitz?\u2019 The idea of him there seemed a\nblashhemy \u2013 but the idea that he wasn\u2019t even more so. No sin, real or imagined, could\nexplain the suffering of men, women and children in that place. The idea of him not being\nthere when, out of the valley of the shadow of death his people cried to him in their\ndistress, seemed unbelievable.\nSuch was the scale of those event, that for twenty years after the Shoah, a theological\nsilence seemed to fall on Judaism - the questions too painful to ask, let alone try to answer.\nAmong contemporary Jewish thinkers the diea arose that the Holocaust, the Shoah was not\nto be understood, but rather responded to. Coming out of a time when it was a crime in\nthe face of some to be a Jew, one response has been a determination to survive, never\nagain to be vulnerable, to be dependant on others for security. A response that has issued\nin the State of Israel\u2019s setting of its own security over and above all other issues of human\nrights and justice in their dealings with the Palestinians \u2013 the oppressed becoming the\noppressor. It does not justify matters but it does provide a context.\nThere was another group who lived through the nightmare of the camps, living each day,\npatiently confronting the never-before-imagined questions and finding answers that\nenabled them to live their faith in the face of evil; discovering that in the face of evil the\nWord of God was not silent. Rather it had, remarked Sacks, an awe inspiring resonance.\nBut where do I find that resonance, that connection between what I see around me and\nthose words we read today:\n\u2018God has said,\n\u201cNever will I leave you;\nnever will I forsake you.\u201d\nPage 3 of 3\nProper 17 \u2013 2007 \u2013 year C \u2013 Trinity 13\nSo we say with confidence,\n\u201cThe Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid.\nWhat can man do to me?\u201d\u2019\nAs I wandered round Auschwitz with those words in my mind, I was confronted with two\nrealities. First there is a dark side to human nature. Secondly the reality, the responsibility\nof moral choice. Man is created free; free to go with God, free to go against God. Take\naway that freedom and moral choice is an illusion. But with moral choice comes aweful\npossibilities when the darker side of human nature comes to the fore \u2013 be it in Auschwitz,\nRwanda or a group of teenagers stoning a pensioner.\nI come to see God, not as one who insulates us from all pain but as one who is with his\npeople in the midst of their trouble, their anguish and their suffering. God did not die at\nAuschwitz, Sacks would argue; He wept tears for his people as they blessed his name at\nthe gates of death. This I think is why I found the cross so powerful. In that anguished cry\nof despair, \u2018My God, my God. Why have you abandoned me?\u2019 I find in Christ a God who\nhas entered into human suffering, who understands the loneliness and despair and emerged\ntriumphant \u2013 and is present with us now through his Spirit.\nThe images of Auschwitz will remain with me probably as long as those of my son and my\ndaughter in law standing before me in St Martin\u2019s in Krakow as I declared them to be\nhusband and wife. I realise, as I reflect on those two images that the God who shared in\nmy joy last weekend is the same God who remains with me and sustains me in the ups and\ndowns of this mortal life. So I think I can begin to understand what the writer of the Letter\nto the Hebrews was getting at as he wrote:\n\u2018God has said,\n\u201cNever will I leave you;\nnever will I forsake you.\u201d\nSo we say with confidence,\n\u201cThe Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid.\nWhat can man do to me?\u201d\u2019"
