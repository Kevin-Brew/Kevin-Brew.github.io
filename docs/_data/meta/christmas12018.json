    "blurb": "This sermon reflects on the meaning of Christmas and the life of Jesus. It explores the puzzlement of Mary at the events surrounding Jesus' life and encourages the congregation to also ponder on the identity and teachings of Jesus. The sermon further draws parallels between Jesus' disappearance for three days in the temple with his death and resurrection.",
    "raw_text": "Christmas is coming and goose is getting fat. Please put a penny in the old man\u2019s hat. So runs the jingle I remember from my own childhood. I would suspect that the goose, or whatever graced your Christmas table, has been plucked clean and whatever pennies we had before Christmas have been well and truly depleted. Each year I would suspect we all ask at some stage or another, \u2018What is it all for?\u2019 and yet we have enjoyed the celebration, the coming together and the fact we make it that bit special with our special foods and other treats.\n\nWhat is it all for, what is it all about is a question we might ask about the arrival of Jesus into the world. \u2018Who is this child?\u2019 Between now and Easter, in our worship Sunday by Sunday, we will be following the developing story of the public ministry of Jesus. Today, in our Gospel reading Luke presents us with the one account in the Gospels of Jesus as a growing child. We are told of a family pilgrimage to Jerusalem. It is a picture every parent could identify with \u2013 a missing child, the agony of searching, the relief, the hurt on finding and their son\u2019s response \u2018Sure, should n\u2019t you have known you would find me here?\u2019\n\nAt face value, Jesus comes across as churlish, apparently indifferent to the concerns of his mother. We need to see this passage in the broader context of the Gospel of Luke. Luke is the only Gospel writer to include any reference to Jesus in his growing years \u2013 so what broader point is Luke trying to convey. This is the fourth of four passages concerning Mary and her response to the coming of Jesus into her life. On each occasion she is presented as being puzzled. Puzzled at the meaning of the annunciation by the angel that she is to conceive and give birth to a saviour; puzzled at what the shepherds had to say about what they had heard the angels say concerning the birth of her son; puzzled at what the aged Simeon had to say about their son when she and Joseph went to present their first born son in the Temple; puzzled at what her son said to his father and her after their frantic search for him. Luke, at the end of his description of two of these said that \u2018Mary treasured these words and kept them in her heart.\u2019 I have a picture here of a woman mulling things over as she watched him grow, as she watched him embark upon his public ministry.\n\nIn a sense this puzzlement, this mulling over is part and parcel of our own response to the man this child is to become. His teaching is sometimes comforting, sometimes challenging, sometimes downright uncomfortable if not seemingly impracticable. To his contemporaries his behaviour could be outrageous in the company he chose to keep, the people he would share meals with; apparently more comfortable in the company of lepers and prostitutes than the religious leaders of his day.\n\nAs we were thinking on Christmas Eve, he is often far from the gentle Jesus, meek and mild that we would often be far more comfortable with. He is presented to us as one who broke moulds, who broke rules, who was very much an anti-establishment figure. Both the political and religious establishment of his day were threatened by him \u2013 which is why they wanted him out of the way.\n\nWho is this man? An interesting and inspiring preacher, a man of great sympathy for the underdog and those on the margins \u2013 yes, there is no doubt he is all of these. But what marks him out from the host of itinerant preachers that roamed Palestine at that time? Why, 2000 years later, are we still following this man?\n\n19 But Mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart. Luke 2:19\n\nTo go back to our Gospel reading. The boy Jesus we are told was missing for three days until he is found. In contemporary Jewish thought, to be lost is synonymous with death, to be found is synonymous with life. Three days calls to mind the time he was to spend in the tomb before being raised from the dead. So even from the very start of his account of Jesus\u2019 life, the Gospel writer is planting very definite images of death and resurrection in our minds as we go on to read the story he has to tell us.\n\nSo as we embark upon our journey towards Good Friday and Easter we are invited to set out on a journey of reflection on who is this Jesus, born in a remote corner of the Roman Empire. He was to spend most of his life in obscurity, to embark upon a short public ministry of teaching and healing and die the death of a criminal and to be reported as risen from the dead.\n\n\u2018Who is he?\u2019 That is a question for us all to ponder in our own hearts \u2013 and that is the work of a lifetime.",

    "summary": "From the sermon provided, here are the top 4 concepts:\n\n1. **Pondering the Meaning of Christmas**: The sermon begins with a reflection on the commercial aspects of Christmas and the deeper question of its true significance, which leads to a contemplation of the purpose and meaning behind the celebration.\n\n2. **The Growth and Ministry of Jesus**: The sermon discusses the only Gospel account of Jesus as a child, his family's pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and the broader context of his growth leading to his public ministry, which is a central theme in the Christian narrative.\n\n3. **Mary's Reflection and Puzzlement**: The sermon highlights Mary's repeated puzzlement and contemplation of the events surrounding Jesus' life, from annunciation to his public ministry, emphasizing her role in treasuring and pondering these events.\n\n4. **Death and Resurrection Imagery**: The sermon connects the story of Jesus being lost for three days with the symbolism of death and resurrection, which is a foreshadowing of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection, a foundational Christian belief.\n\nFor a non-religious black and white pencil diagram that can be created by DALL-E 3, I would select the first concept, **Pondering the Meaning of Christmas**, as it can be represented in a more abstract and universal way without direct religious symbolism.\n\n**Detailed Prompt for DALL-E 3:**\n\n\"Create a black and white pencil diagram that depicts a serene winter landscape with a variety of individuals from diverse backgrounds sitting around a large, leafless tree, each person in a thoughtful pose, as if reflecting on the deeper meaning of a communal celebration.
