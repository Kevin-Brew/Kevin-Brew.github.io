    "raw_text": "4th Sunday of Easter \u2013 Year A \u2013 2019\nBaptism of Frederick and Sebastian Black\n\nThis morning for our family service we are welcoming two children into the fellowship of the Church in Baptism. As you no doubt realise, I enjoy baptisms. You will also realise that I find in the service of Baptism, in the promises made, much food for thought as I think about that journey that is the life of faith. One of my jobs when I was in Finglas, was the chaplaincy to the Rotunda Hospital. I really enjoyed those three years, the contact with staff, with the mothers and with their new born children. New babies have never ceased to amaze me \u2013 the perfect miniature detail of those hands \u2013 the fingers, the finger nails \u2013 magic.\n\nTalking to Mums and Dads for a minute, when babies arrive as parents we realise, in a way we never did before they were born, they depend on us \u2013 in the early days of little sleep and lots of exhaustion it is food and drink and warmth and love \u2013 then of course there are lifts, football kits to be bought and washed, shoulders to cry on, someone to shout and scream at, to borrow money off, who is going to love and be proud of them through it all.\n\nA lot of what we offer can be summed up under two headings Nutrition \u2013 the food we give, the love and understanding Guidance \u2013 the advice, the education, the listening ear.\n\nThese two children are already an irreplaceable part of their human family. This morning we welcome them into the wider family of the Church. Our lessons this morning have talked a bit about nutrition and guidance.\n\nIn our first lesson, Peter was talking to the early Christians about the importance of looking for \u2018pure spiritual milk that you may grow.\u2019 and elsewhere Jesus will talk of himself as \u2018the bread of life\u2019. In our second lesson Jesus talks of himself as being the \u2018way, the truth and the life\u2019.\n\nThese children are already physically very well looked after and loved as part of their own family \u2013 how do we look after them as part of the family of the Church?\n\nThis morning their parents and godparents were asked a number of questions \u2013 I asked them \u2018will you walk with them in the way of Christ?\u2019 and then \u2018will you help them take their place within the life and worship of Christ\u2019s Church?\u2019\n\nA lot of it is going to fall on their Mum and Dad \u2013 but not all of it \u2013 we all have a part to play.\n\nWhen they come here are they just going to hear about following Jesus \u2013 or are they going to see people around them to live that out in practice?\n\nLater on in the service we will all say to Frederick and Sebastian:\n\nWe welcome you into the fellowship of faith;\nwe are children of the same heavenly Father;\nwe welcome you.\n\nAre they going to feel that welcome in the years to come as they take their place in the life of the Church?\n\nSo today, in this Family Service, we welcome two new members into our family, the Church. May God bless them and their Mum and Dad and all who will have the care of them in the days and weeks and years to come.",
