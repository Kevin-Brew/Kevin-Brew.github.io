Shared faith 1 John 1.3 We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father, and with his son Jesus Christ.

FELLOWSHIP

Worship Acts 2:42 They devoted themselves to the apostlesâ€™ teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers.

PARTICIPATION

Eucharist 1 Cor 10:16 Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the Body of Christ?

IDENTIFICATION

Life Phil 3:10 10I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the sharing of his sufferings by becoming like him in his death,

CHARITABLE HELP

Outworking in life Hebrews 13:16 Do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.
