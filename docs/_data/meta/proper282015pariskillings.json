    "blurb": "This sermon reflects on the horrific Paris attacks, questioning where God is in such tragedies and how faith can respond. It emphasizes that God is not the instrument of evil but is present with those facing it. The sermon also discusses the misuse of faith to justify evil deeds and the importance of supporting moderate voices within Islam.",
    "raw_text": "2ND Sunday before Advent \u2013 Proper 28 \u2013 2015\nSunday after Paris attacks\n\nLast Friday night as people were settling down to watch the \u2018Late Late\u2019 or whatever else we were doing at that time, horrendous events were unfolding on the streets of Paris. I would suspect that this is going to be one of those events, like the death of John F Kennedy, the attack on the World Trade Centre in New York, when we will remember what we were doing that night. Oblivious to what was going on, I was at a Trinity dinner in Belfast, meeting up with old friends I had not seen for years, listening as Senator David Norris regaled us with his wonderful wit \u2013 only in the morning, as I checked my phone for news bulletins, did I begin to grasp the sheer horror of what had happened. As with you, I\u2019m sure, a whole range of thoughts, questions, confusions swirled about in my mind.\n\nFirst of all there is the fundamental question of \u2018Where is God in all this?\u2019 What can faith say in the face of bodies piled up in a Paris theatre? What can faith say to a parent or partner or child of someone lying in a morgue or fighting for their life in a intensive care unit in Paris this morning? There can be no room for platitudes, it must be all part of his plan, all these things happen for a purpose. What happened in Paris was evil and needs to be named as such. To say that God allows these things, to say that God wills these things is nothing short of blasphemy. So where is God, where is faith in all of this?\n\nAs I often do on occasions such as this, I found myself turning to the writing of Dr Jonathan Sacks, former Chief Rabbi of the Great Britain and the Commonwealth. In an essay he wrote \u2018On God and Auschwitz\u2019, he asks this fundamental question:\n\n\u2018But where was God? That he was present seemed a blasphemy; that he was absent, even more so. How could he have been there, punishing the righteous and the children for their sins, their own or someone else\u2019s? But how could he NOT have been there, when, from the valley of the shadow of death, they called out to him?\u2019\n\nFor me I begin to build my thoughts out of that apparent contradiction. God not the instrument of evil but present with those who are facing evil. The God who in Christ calls out to the Father, \u2018My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\u2019 \u2013 who promised his disciples, \u2018I am with you always \u2013 to the very end of the age.\u2019 We are not alone - God travels the road with us, strengthening us, comforting us, encouraging us, listening to our pain, our anger, our distress \u2013 this is the God who encounters us in the Psalms, listening to the hurt and pain of his people.\n\nOf course faith has been distorted to justify awful deeds such as we saw in Paris on Friday night. At the end of last year our President wrote a poem, \u2018The Prophets are weeping\u2019 that has been inspired by events we have seen in Iraq and Syria, the rise of the evil fundamentalism that is ISIS, the trail of misery of refugees fleeing war and persecution. Speaking to a group of young people, before reading this poem, he spoke of \u201cincredible threats from those who abuse sacred texts\u201d.\n\nThe Prophets are Weeping\n\nTo those on the road it is reported that\nThe Prophets are weeping,\nAt the abuse\nOf their words,\nScattered to sow an evil seed.\nRumour has it that,\nThe Prophets are weeping,\nAt their texts distorted,\nThe death and destruction,\nImposed in their name.\nThe sun burns down,\nOn the children who are crying,\nOn the long journeys repeated,\nTheir questions not answered.\nMothers and Fathers hide their faces,\nUnable to explain,\nWhy they must endlessly,\nNo end in sight,\nMove for shelter,\n\nfor food, for safety, for hope.\nThe Prophets are weeping,\nFor the words that have been stolen,\nFrom texts that once offered,\nTo reveal in ancient times,\nA shared space,\nOf love and care,\nAbove all for the stranger. M.D.H. 2014\n\nThe President of France, in speaking to the nation on Friday night, promised the French people that those who directed and organised the attacks would be vigorously pursued. He is quite right \u2013 evil must be opposed and dealt with. But how is that to be done? One of the troubling features of last Friday\u2019s events is the passport that was found of one of the attackers. It was a Syrian passport and it would appear that the holder was registered as a refugee in Greece. It would be tempting to say that Europe should take no more refugees. But do we just abandon them to their fate? Surely that would be to allow the brutality and inhumanity of others to diminish our own Christian understanding of humanity and justice \u2013 in a very real sense, if we do that then the extremists have won.\n\nOne of the key issues that must be addressed in this whole process is how do we engage with and support moderate voices within Islam as they seek to stand up to extremists within their own community. Let us not forget that many of those fleeing the Middle East are members of the Islamic community who have fallen foul of ISIS, whose relatives and community members have been murdered and who have fled for their lives.\n\nWe live in difficult and dangerous times. On this day we pray for the city of Paris, for the people of France as they come to terms with the horrific events of last Friday; for those who have been scarred in body, mind and soul, for those who mourn, for those who are tempted to turn to hate and thoughts of revenge against innocent people. We pray for leaders of governments as they seek to resolve the long standing issues that have divided the Middle East, that have fuelled the emergence of extremist groups such as ISIS. We pray for those responsible for security, for protection of our citizens. We pray that God may stand alongside those who, across divisions of culture, of race, of creed, work for peace, for reconciliation, for justice in our world.\n\nThis is not God\u2019s will \u2013 these are the actions of evil and distorted minds. God is with us in the pain, in the questioning, in the anger and the hurt. In his presence, may we find something of his peace.\n\nI will just close with part of President Higgin\u2019s poem:\n\nTo those on the road it is reported that\nThe Prophets are weeping,\nAt the abuse\nOf their words,\nScattered to sow an evil seed.\nRumour has it that,\nThe Prophets are weeping,\nAt their texts distorted,\nThe death and destruction,\nImposed in their name.",

    "summary": "From the sermon provided, I have extracted the following top four concepts:\n\n1. The Presence of God in Suffering: The sermon grapples with the question of where God is during tragic events, suggesting that God is not the instrument of evil but is present with those who face evil, offering comfort and strength.\n\n2. The Misuse of Religious Texts: The sermon addresses the issue of sacred texts being distorted to justify acts of violence, as reflected in the poem \"The Prophets are Weeping,\" which laments the abuse of prophetic words for evil purposes.\n\n3. The Response to Evil: The sermon discusses the necessity of opposing and dealing with evil, while also highlighting the importance of not letting the actions of extremists diminish our own humanity and sense of justice.\n\n4. Solidarity and Support for the Moderates: The sermon calls for engagement with and support for moderate voices within Islam and recognizes the plight of those fleeing extremism, emphasizing the need for a collective effort towards peace, reconciliation, and justice.\n\nFor a non-religious black and white pencil diagram that can be graphically represented, the concept of \"The Response to Evil\" seems the most suitable, as it can be depicted through symbolic imagery without direct religious connotations. Here is a detailed prompt for DALL-E 3:\n\nPrompt for DALL-E 3:\n\"Create a black and white pencil drawing that symbolizes the concept of responding to evil with humanity and justice.
