    "raw_text": "This sermon focuses on the use of the word 'Kingdom' in Matthew. It begins with Matthew 3:1 where John the Baptist proclaims, 'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.' It continues with references from Matthew 4:17, Luke 6:20, and Matthew 4:23, where Jesus proclaims the good news of the kingdom and cures every disease and sickness among the people.\n\nThe sermon also highlights the Beatitudes in Matthew 5, where the kingdom of heaven is promised to the poor in spirit and those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake. The Lord's Prayer in Matthew 6:10 is also referenced, with a focus on the line, 'Your kingdom come. Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.'\n\nThe sermon then moves on to discuss the concept of a kingdom divided against itself in Matthew 12:25, and the various comparisons made to the kingdom of heaven in Matthew 13. It also discusses the barriers to the kingdom as mentioned in Matthew 6:31 and Matthew 19:23, and the inheritors of the kingdom as described in Matthew 18:1 and Matthew 25:34.\n\nFinally, the sermon concludes with references to the Annunciation in Luke 1:31 and the presence of the kingdom in Luke 17:20, where Jesus states, 'The kingdom of God is not coming with things that can be observed; nor will they say, 'Look, here it is!' or 'There it is!' For, in fact, the kingdom of God is among you.'",
