    "blurb": "In this sermon, Kevin reflects on the deep sense of belonging that comes from following Jesus. He shares a personal story about a lost sheep that finds its way back to the flock, drawing parallels with our own spiritual journey. Kevin emphasizes the importance of listening and following Jesus, even when we don't fully understand His ways. He assures us of Jesus's protection and love, that nothing can separate us from.",
    "raw_text": "4th Sunday of Easter \u2013 year C \u2013 2013. 27My sheep hear my voice. I know them, and they follow me. John 10:27\n\nWhenever I read those words in St John\u2019s Gospel my mind goes back to a hillside in Galilee. Rachel and I had lead a group to the Holy Land and this particular day had been spent on Lake Galilee. Towards the end of the day our group had celebrated communion on the hills overlooking the Lake. We were relaxing while we waited for our bus to come and collect us. As we sat there a shepherd came by, leading his flock. One of the younger sheep spotted something tasty by the side of the road and stopped to eat it. By the time it had finished, the rest of the flock had moved on. The poor thing looked up to see no flock or shepherd, just a bunch of complete strangers staring at it. Panic set it and it started bleating frantically. The shepherd, now some way off, heard the noise and called out. The sheep heard the familiar voice and ran off to join it. The shepherd had heard the cry for help and responded; the sheep recognised the familiar voice and headed towards it.\n\nThere is a picture here of deep belonging. The sheep belongs to that flock not by any action of its own, not by any virtue of its own \u2013 it simply belongs and will continue to do so for as long as the shepherd so desires. Following Jesus has at its heart this sense of belonging, of knowing who we follow. Looking back over my own pilgrimage, this sense of belonging, of knowing whom I follow, very much pre-dated any understanding of Christian doctrine, came long before a particularly detailed knowledge of the Bible. Rather it was in the context of a relationship, a sense of belonging, that I came to grow in my understanding of scripture or Christian doctrine.\n\nAnd so I began my own walk with Jesus not really sure who I was following or indeed why. Concepts such as atonement, redemption, the doctrine of the Trinity did not enter my thoughts for some considerable time. What I did know was that Jesus was special and I wanted to know more. There was also that definite feeling that my search mattered to him \u2013 that he was not indifferent to my search \u2013 he reached out to me and drew me further on.\n\nThe religious leaders who confronted Jesus in the Temple precincts were coming at things from a very different angle. \u2018How long will you keep us in suspense?\u2019 Literally, how long will you take our life from us? \u2018If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.\u2019 These men knew exactly who they were looking for. They were looking for the Messiah of Jewish national expectations. A strong national leader who would lift the Roman yoke, who would establish the Kingdom of Israel as God\u2019s rule on earth.\n\nI think of the question that John the Baptist sent to Jesus from his prison cell; \u2018Are you the one \u2013 or are we to wait for another?\u2019; and the answer that Jesus sent back, \u2018Tell John what you see, the blind see, the lame walk and the poor have the Good News preached to them.\u2019 Jesus is not confined by human categories. His agenda is set not by human expectations; nor by our understanding of God\u2019s purposes. The religious leaders of the day were basically asking Jesus for information \u2013 they would then decide whether or not he fitted the bill.\n\nJesus protests that there is already ample evidence available to them in the works that he has done. They do not believe because they are not his sheep. In other words Jesus is a stranger to them, to their mind set, to their expectations. The first step in understanding Jesus is to take the risk of listening, of following where he leads. The disciples, at the outset of Jesus\u2019 ministry, responded to a call to leave all and follow him. They did not at that stage understand who he was. That came later, much later. All they did know was that he had laid a claim on them and they felt they could do no other than follow.\n\nHe then goes on to promise protection to the flock, to those who hear the voice. As I was saying earlier, I sensed, in the context of my own beginnings in the faith, that I had the feeling that my search mattered to Jesus, that as I reached out to him, he reached out to me, drawing me closer to his presence. He promises, of his sheep, that no-one can snatch them out of his hand. The word that is used here for \u2018snatch\u2019 is the same as that used of a wolf that attacks the fold. Such protection comes at the cost of the loss of the Shepherd\u2019s life; the Good Shepherd who lays down his life for the sheep.\n\nThat is a protection that stands firm in the face of all tribulation, all fear, all anxiety. I think of Paul\u2019s declaration in his letter to the Church at Rome:\n\n35 Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will hardship, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? \u2026..37 No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. 38 For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor rulers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, 39 nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord. Rom 8:35, 37-39\n\nA promise that reaches its fulfilment in the vision of the heavenly court in the Revelation to St John the Divine:\n\nthey are before the throne of God, and worship him day and night within his temple, and the one who is seated on the throne will shelter them. 16They will hunger no more, and thirst no more; the sun will not strike them, nor any scorching heat; 17for the Lamb at the centre of the throne will be their shepherd, and he will guide them to springs of the water of life, and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.\u2019 Rev7:15-17\n\nThe Christ who calls is the Christ who strengthens and protects, who gives himself for the sake of the sheep.",

In the foreground, a group of strangers is sitting and observing the lamb. The focus is on the lamb's attentive posture, with its ears perked up as it hears a distant call. In the far background, barely visible, a figure of a shepherd with an outstretched hand is calling out to the lamb. The shepherd should be depicted as a simple human figure without any religious attire or symbols, blending into the natural landscape. The scene should capture the moment of recognition and the beginning of the lamb's run towards the shepherd, illustrating trust and guidance without the use of any text or overt religious imagery.",
    "summary": "From the sermon provided, here are the top 4 concepts:\n\n1. **The Shepherd's Voice**: The concept of recognizing and following the familiar and trusted voice of the shepherd, as the sheep in the story do, symbolizes the believers' recognition and following of Jesus.\n\n2. **Sense of Belonging**: The idea that followers of Jesus have an inherent sense of belonging to a community, which is not based on their actions or virtues but on their relationship with the shepherd (Jesus).\n\n3. **Protection and Providence**: The promise of protection to the flock from all tribulations, symbolized by the shepherd's willingness to lay down his life for the sheep, and the assurance that nothing can separate the believers from the love of Christ.\n\n4. **Guidance to Salvation**: The imagery of the shepherd guiding the sheep to \"springs of the water of life\" and the ultimate fulfillment of God's promise in the heavenly court, where there is no suffering, and every tear is wiped away.\n\nFor a non-religious black and white pencil diagram that can be represented graphically, the first concept, **The Shepherd's Voice**, seems most suitable. It can be depicted without religious symbols and still convey the essence of guidance, trust, and recognition.\n\nHere's a detailed prompt for DALL-E 3 to create an image for the concept of \"The Shepherd's Voice\":\n\n\"Create a detailed black and white pencil sketch of a pastoral scene in which a single lost lamb stands on a grassy hillside, looking off into the distance.
