    "raw_text": "Funeral of Paul (PK) Kavanagh \u2013 1st October 2016 \u2013 St Mary\u2019s\n\nLast weekend Paul Kavanagh (PK to his friends) had travelled North with his son Max for a sailing event. It was a trip that was to end in his sudden death leaving his family and his friends shocked and saddened. Paul had grown up in Finglas. He had set up his own business, Apollo Blinds, and in time had come to live on the Dublin Road in Sutton. Here he and Jill raised their two lads Alex and Max. His own family moved to Australia but Paul chose to stay here, maintaining close contacts over the years. The family speak of PK\u2019s three great passions in life; sailing, which he took to in his 20\u2019s, rugby and the lads.\n\nHis death in Northern Ireland last Sunday struck everyone out of the blue. It was all so sudden. That suddenness can catch us all off balance. There are no chances for goodbyes; it sharpens our awareness of loss; something in us still cannot believe this has happened. A funeral, a memorial service provides us with an occasion to reflect.\n\nWe come to set the mystery of death in the context of our Christian faith. I begin with Easter, with life triumphant over death that lies at the heart of our faith, that we celebrate in the Eucharist Sunday by Sunday. In our Gospel reading, Jesus, speaking to the disciples on the eve of his Passion, talks of separation. Separation, bereavement, is always difficult, always painful.\n\n> Do not let your hearts be troubled: trust in God, trust also in me \u2026\u2026 that where I am, there you may also be \u2026\u2026 27Peace I leave with you, my peace I give you. I do not give as the world gives. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid\n\nIn all this, as the Gospels unfold the story of Jesus I am reminded that we follow a Lord who knows what death, what suffering, what loss is all about; one who knew what it was like to weep and the grave of his friend Lazarus. Not only that, he is the one who was raised triumphant over death, breaking the power of death itself.\n\nOn this day, as we have come to thank God for the life of Paul, of PK Kavanagh and the love we have shared with him, we have come also to offer our love and support to those who will miss her most. May you, the family and friends of Paul Kavanagh know something of the presence of Christ in these coming days and in his presence come to know something of his peace.",

It was a trip that was to end in his sudden death\nleaving his family and his friends shocked and saddened. Paul had grown up in\nFinglas. He had set up his own business, Apollo Blinds, and in time had come\nto live on the Dublin Road in Sutton. Here he and Jill raised their two lads\nAlex and Max. His own family moved to Australia but Paul chose to stay here,\nmaintaining close contacts over the years. The family speak of PK\u2019s three\ngreat passions in life; sailing, which he took to in his 20\u2019s, rugby and the lads.\nAs the large attendance here today bears witness his interest in sailing and\nrugby was more than just a passing interest. He threw himself into the\norganisation, making things better for the whole membership. He was proud of\nboth his sons, Alex and Max and took great pride in watching them grow up\nand develop their own skills and talents. Members of the family will be sharing\ntheir own particular memories of PK.\nHis death in Northern Ireland last Sunday struck everyone out of the blue. It\nwas all so sudden. That suddenness can catch us all off balance. There are no\nchances for goodbyes; it sharpens our awareness of loss; something in us still\ncannot believe this has happened. A funeral, a memorial service provides us\nwith an occasion to reflect. As part of our preparation of ourselves for this\nservice, we look back and realise how much our lives were intertwined not\nonly in the big things but the simple things of sharing meals, watching the\nrugby, the sailing, the lift to school in the morning, just being in each other\u2019s\ncompany, the simple conversations in which advice was given, in which\nthoughts were shared. We thank God for all that PK has meant to us and will\ncontinue to mean to us.\nThose of us outside the immediate family circle have come here today to show\nour love and our sympathy to those who will miss PK most. We think\nparticularly of Jill, their sons Alex and Max as well as Paul\u2019s brothers, John\nPage 2 of 3\nFuneral of Paul (PK) Kavanagh \u2013 1st October 2016 \u2013 St Mary\u2019s\nand David, and his sister, Betty and their families. We offer them our love and\nour sympathy not just today but for the months to come as they come to terms\nwith life without Paul.\nAny death, but particularly a sudden death, is a reminder to us all that life is\nprecious, life is a gift; we are reminded of the importance of taking the\nopportunities it offers, opportunities to express love, of not taking each other\nfor granted, of making use of the opportunities that life brings our way. It is a\nreminder in short of our own mortality.\nWe come to set the mystery of death in the context of our Christian faith. I\nbegin with Easter, with life triumphant over death that lies at the heart of our\nfaith, that we celebrate in the Eucharist Sunday by Sunday. In our Gospel\nreading, Jesus, speaking to the disciples on the eve of his Passion, talks of\nseparation. Separation, bereavement, is always difficult, always painful. There\nis a finality that I spoke of earlier \u2013 the suddenness is final, it is unfair and it\nhurts. Into all that Jesus speaks words of comfort, words of hope\nDo not let your hearts be troubled: trust in God, trust also in me\n\u2026\u2026\u2026. that where I am, there you may also be \u2026\u2026. 27Peace I leave\nwith you, my peace I give you. I do not give as the world gives. Let\nnot your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid\nThese are not thoughts that come naturally to us at a time such as this when our\nhearts are hurting. So we the friends, the school friends the colleagues, the\nwider family gather round in love and support, listening to the hurt, the sadness\nand the loss so that in our faltering words, our simple presence, something of\nChrist\u2019s love may be known.\nIn all this, as the Gospels unfold the story of Jesus I am reminded that we\nfollow a Lord who knows what death, what suffering, what loss is all about;\none who knew what it was like to weep and the grave of his friend Lazarus.Not\nonly that, he is the one who was raised triumphant over death, breaking the\nPage 3 of 3\nFuneral of Paul (PK) Kavanagh \u2013 1st October 2016 \u2013 St Mary\u2019s\npower of death itself. Knowing in his own person what it was all about, I find\nin him one to whom I cam come in my own time of suffering and find real\ncomfort, real strength and real hope.\nOn this day, as we have come to thank God for the life of Paul, of PK\nKavanagh and the love we have shared with him, we have come also to offer\nour love and support to those who will miss her most. May you, the family and\nfriends of Paul Kavanagh know something of the presence of Christ in these\ncoming days and in his presence come to know something of his peace\nThinking of PK\u2019s love of sailing I will close with this parable of immortality:\nI am standing by the seashore.\nA ship at my side spreads her white sails to the morning breeze\nand starts for the blue ocean.\nShe is an object of beauty and strength,\nand I stand and watch\nuntil at last she hangs like a speck of white cloud\njust where the sun and sky come down to mingle with each other.\nThen someone at my side says, \u2018There she goes! \u2018\nGone where? Gone from my sight - that is all.\nShe is just as large in mast and hull and spar\nas she was when she left my side\nand just as able to bear her load of living freight\nto the places of destination.\nHer diminished size is in me, not in her.\nAnd just at the moment when someone at my side says,\n\u2018There she goes!\u2019,\nthere are other eyes watching her coming,\nand other voices ready to take up the glad shout :\n\u2018Here she comes!\u2019"
