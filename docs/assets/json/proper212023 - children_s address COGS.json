        "Admiration of Heroes": "The speech discusses the admiration of heroes, highlighting individuals like Rory McIlroy, Carl Frampton, and Mary Earps. It emphasizes not just their skills and achievements, but also their character traits such as determination and involvement in peace and reconciliation efforts.",
        "Inspiration from Heroes": "The speaker talks about how heroes inspire us and make us aspire to be like them. The concept of being inspired by someone's actions and character is central to this part of the speech.",
        "Integration of Faith and Science": "The speaker mentions a personal hero who taught them that faith and science could be held together, suggesting a harmony between spiritual beliefs and scientific understanding."
    },
    "selected_concept": "Inspiration from Heroes",
    "rational_for_selection": "The concept of 'Inspiration from Heroes' is chosen because it is broad and can be visualized without religious or warlike imagery. It can be depicted through symbols of aspiration and admiration that are universally understood.",
    "image_prompt": "A pencil drawing of a person standing on a mountain peak, looking up at the stars with a sense of wonder and aspiration, symbolizing the inspiration drawn from heroes.",
    "prompt": "Create a detailed black and white pencil sketch that illustrates the harmonious integration of faith and science. The image should feature a large tree with roots and branches intertwining. The roots, depicted with scientific symbols like atoms, DNA helices, and mathematical equations, delve deep into the ground, symbolizing the foundation of science. The branches reach upwards and transform into ethereal hands that gently cradle a glowing orb, representing the light of faith. In the background, a faint yin-yang symbol is subtly woven into the pattern of the tree's bark, emphasizing the balance between these two realms. No human figures, religious texts, or explicit religious symbols should be present, ensuring the focus remains on the abstract representation of the coexistence of faith and science.",
    "summary": "Based on the text you've provided, here are the top four concepts from the sermon:\n\n1. **Admiration of Heroes**: The concept of looking up to individuals not just for their achievements but also for their character and determination.\n2. **Integration of Faith and Science**: The idea that faith and scientific understanding can coexist and complement each other, as exemplified by the speaker's hero, ETSW.\n3. **Sportsmanship and Athletic Excellence**: Highlighting the skill and sportsmanship of athletes like Rory McIlroy and the remarkable performance of Mary Earps in the World Cup Final.\n4. **Peace and Reconciliation**: The work done by individuals like Carl Frampton, who, beyond their athletic prowess, contribute to societal good by working towards peace and reconciliation.\n\nFor a non-religious black and white pencil diagram that can be graphically represented, the concept of \"Integration of Faith and Science\" seems particularly suitable, as it can be depicted through symbols and metaphors without directly referencing religious elements.\n\nHere is a detailed prompt for DALL-E 3 to create an image for the concept of \"Integration of Faith and Science\":\n\n\"Create a detailed black and white pencil sketch that illustrates the harmonious integration of faith and science.
