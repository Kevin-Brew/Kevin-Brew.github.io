    "blurb": "Kevin explores the question 'Who do you say that I am?' through the lens of personal inspiration and influence. He compares admiration of public figures to the deeper, more personal impact of family and individuals who shape our lives. Ultimately, he points to Jesus as the Christ, whose life, death, and resurrection bring us closest to encountering God himself.",
    "raw_text": "### PROPER 19 \u2013 Year B \u2013 2015 \u2013 Trinity 15\n\n**Family Service**\n\nWho do you say that I am? - We've been following the story of Jesus from his birth \u2013 what is special about him. People admire him \u2013 but then we admire lots of people \u2013 let's look at some. We might recognise these people, we might admire them \u2013 Jesus is looking for more than that.\n\nThere are people who inspire us, who make us think deeply about life, about issues. This can be very personal \u2013 the person who inspires me might not be the one who inspires you. Here are three people who have inspired me down through the years:\n\n> Michael Ramsey\n> Ernest Walton\n> Gordon Wilson\n\nJesus certainly inspired people \u2013 but again there is more to him than that. Then there are those people who have made us the people we are. Our parents, Mum and Dad, quite apart from inheriting their looks, something of their mannerisms, their character \u2013 it is from our parents, in our families, that we first learn the basic lessons of life \u2013 they are the ones who have encouraged, have loved.\n\nIt is in this family relationship that we start getting close to an answer to that question, 'Who do you say that I am?' As Peter answers 'You are the Christ, the Messiah.' In Jesus, in his life, death and resurrection we come close to, we encounter God himself. There are people we admire, there are people who inspire us \u2013 but there is something about this Jesus that compels me to declare \u2013 Jesu, Jesu, I thee adore. Help me love thee more and more.",
