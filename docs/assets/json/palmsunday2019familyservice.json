    "blurb": "This sermon from Palm Sunday 2019 focuses on the concept of 'I' and how it can be used both positively and negatively. It emphasizes the importance of controlling the 'I' and aligning our attitudes and lives with Jesus. The sermon concludes with the prayer of St Ignatius, providing a pattern for living in the footsteps of Jesus.",
    "raw_text": "Palm Sunday \u2013 2019 \u2013 Family Service\n\nPalm Sunday \u2013 we began with the story of Jesus\u2019 entry into Jerusalem. Started with a cheering crowd \u2013 ends with Jesus on the Cross, with his enemies jeering. What happened?\n\nWe will start with keeping things simple. What letter does this represent? (Hold up piece of wood) That letter is quite important to us if you think about it \u2013 we use it a lot.\n\nWe use to express opinions \u2013 \u2018I think Birmingham City are a great football team.\u2019\n\nWe use it to express our affection \u2013 we might say to someone \u2018I love you\u2019\n\nWe use it to encourage other people \u2013 \u2018I think you are looking great today\u2019; \u2018I think you are really good at doing that\u2019.\n\nBut \u2018I\u2019 is not always so pleasant.\n\nWe can use it to express prejudice \u2013 \u2018I think foreigners are lazy, or stupid, or dishonest.\u2019\n\nWe can use it to express hatred \u2013 \u2018I hate you.\u2019; \u2018I despise you.\u2019\n\nWe can use it to undermine people \u2013 \u2018I think you are stupid.\u2019; \u2018I think you are ugly.\u2019\n\nSo the letter \u2018I\u2019 needs to be controlled a bit. In fact sometimes I need to cross the letter \u2018I\u2019 out. (Put cross bar in place and hold up) Now what do I get?\n\nThat\u2019s right a cross \u2013 the cross is, if you like, the letter \u2018I\u2019 crossed out.\n\n\u2018I\u2019 crossed out in many ways describes not just the death of Jesus but the whole of his life. That is summed beautifully in those words Paul wrote to the Church at Philippi as he encouraged them to model their attitudes and life on those of Jesus himself. I am going to read it from the translation, \u2018The Message\u2019.\n\nPhil2:5-8 Think of yourselves the way Christ Jesus thought of himself. He had equal status with God but didn\u2019t think so much of himself that he had to cling to the advantages of that status no matter what. Not at all. When the time came, he set aside the privileges of deity and took on the status of a slave, became human! Having become human, he stayed human. It was an incredibly humbling process. He didn\u2019t claim special privileges. Instead, he lived a selfless, obedient life and then died a selfless, obedient death\u2014and the worst kind of death at that\u2014a crucifixion.\n\nOn one occasion Jesus told his followers, \u201cIf any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me.\u201d How can we think of taking up our cross daily? We find our example in that selfless obedient life of Jesus, life lived with the \u2018I\u2019 crossed out. A life in which I seek to encourage people rather than undermine them; in which I express love and not hatred, in which we turn our back on prejudice and honour one another.\n\nI will just close with the prayer of St Ignatius which I think gives us a lovely pattern for living in the footsteps of Jesus.\n\nTeach us, good Lord, to serve thee as thou deservest;\n\nTo give, and not to count the cost,\n\nTo fight, and not to heed the wounds,\n\nTo toil, and not to seek for rest,\n\nTo labor, and not to ask for any reward,\n\nSave that of knowing that we do thy will.",
