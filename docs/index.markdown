<p> This purpose of this project is to digitize and publish the sermons of my Dad, Kevin Brew. </p> 

<p> Dad's collection of sermons spanned from the late 70's until now. He had a bunch of sermons printed out on rolling printer paper which he has scanned in, some in .doc format and some in .docs. Also during COVID he gave his services online. </p>

<p> The <b>current</b> primary reason for this repository is to put all his sermons (or as many as he can find!) in one place, in a standard format. This is because he is planning to write a book and so having all the content in one place might enable a bit of human and machine analysis to see if there are common threads across his works that he might use as a foundation for his work </p>

<p> It might also be of interest to you, you might want to read his old sermons or it could be a good dataset for some NLP tasks such as topic analysis of sermons over time. Over time I will add some more content here based on what we find!
