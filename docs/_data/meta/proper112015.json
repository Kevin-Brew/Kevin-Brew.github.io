    "blurb": "Kevin discusses the importance of identity and community through the lens of biblical history and the story of David. He emphasizes that the Church is not just a building, but the community that gathers within it. The sermon reflects on the significance of buildings and how they can either distort or enhance our spiritual journey, urging the congregation to focus on faithfulness to God rather than the physical structures.",
    "raw_text": "PROPER 11 \u2013 2015 \u2013 year B \u2013 Trinity 7\n\nOver the summer months there are many visitors who come to Ireland. Among these are visitors who come from North America, from Australia and New Zealand. Many come not only to visit the areas their forebears grew up in but also to discover something about their ancestors, who they were, what their background was. There is a search for identity beyond what they work at, the money they earn, the car they drive.\n\nOver these past few weeks in our readings from the Old Testament we have been following the story of David, his anointing by Samuel, his defeat of Goliath, his rise to power despite all efforts of Saul to eliminate him, his bringing together of all the tribes of Israel into a single Kingdom. David, born to be a shepherd boy, grew up to be King of Israel, probably the greatest King Israel every had, one from whom, Jesus was destined to be descended.\n\nIn our Lesson this morning we find David now established in his capital, living in a palace, the Ark of God, symbolising the presence of God with his people, continued to be housed in a tent as it had during the time of wandering in the wilderness. The King shares with the prophet Nathan his desire to build a Temple as a more fitting place to house the Ark of God. Nathan's first reaction is to say do what you feel is right. But that night Nathan feels God telling him to tell David to hold back, that this is not the right time. Before a Temple was to be built, the Lord would first establish the community. Before the house of the Lord is built, the house of David will first be established.\n\nThis links in with the closing words of the passage we read from the Letter to the Ephesians: \"In whom you also are built together spiritually into a dwelling-place for God.\" (Eph 2:22) This underlines what we know to be true \u2013 that when we speak of the Church, we speak first of the community and only then on the building in which that community meets.\n\nWhat is at issue here is the whole matter of identity and where we find that identity. This is the same issue at stake in whether David was to build the Temple at that particular point in time. For buildings, even our most beautiful and impressive buildings can, if we allow them, distort rather than enhance our spiritual pilgrimage. The people had to go through the painful experience of the Exile to rediscover their identity as the People of God.\n\nWe are now preparing to celebrate the 150th Anniversary of the Consecration of our Parish Church and the 200th Anniversary of the Church that was on this site beforehand, the tower of which is incorporated into St Mary's. We are very conscious that we are remembering not just the building of this Church but also the community that has worshipped here over the years. This building is held in great affection and as we restore the roof we are preserving this building for use by future generations. But as I remind every confirmation group, this building is not the Church. The Church is the community that meets here for worship. Or as Bishop Noel Willoughby once said in General Synod, 'The Church is what is left when the building has fallen down.' As so as we prepare a history of our Parish we are compiling not just a history of this building but of the people who have made this Parish what it is \u2013 so we are looking for photographs, for stories, for memorabilia \u2013 so that we can tell the story of who we are as a community.\n\nAs we prepare to move forward the Vestry are in the process of having a look at how we use this building into the future. So prior to work beginning on the roof we are beginning a process of trying out a few things. The choir now comes down here for Family Services and that has worked well. Over the last number of weeks we have tried roping off some of the pews to draw us closer together in our worship. Our hymn singing has definitely benefitted. At present, there is a huge gap between me at the communion table and the first of the pews that have people sitting in them \u2013 so we will be moving the Communion Table further forward to a point level with the pulpit for a while \u2013 the idea is we gather around the table rather than watch what is going on at the table. We are not looking for an immediate reaction. There is nothing set in stone \u2013 let us just see how it feels over a period of time.\n\nI go back to the fundamental truth that the Church here is the community that gathers around this place; this Church of St Mary which has been the place where people have worshipped, have celebrated family occasions, where they have come to seek solace in times of loss. How can this building continue to serve the community that is the Church in this place as we move into the future?",

But that night Nathan\nfeels God telling him to tell David to hold back, that this is not the right time.\nBefore a Temple was to be built, the Lord would first establish the community.\nBefore the house of the Lord is built, the house of David will first be\nestablished.\nPage 2 of 4\nPROPER 11 \u2013 2015 \u2013 year B \u2013 Trinity 7\nThis links in with the closing words of the passage we read from the Letter to\nthe Ephesians\n22in whom you also are built together spiritually into a dwelling-place\nfor God. Eph 2:22\nThis underlines what we know to be true \u2013 that when we speak of the Church,\nwe speak first of the community and only then on the building in which that\ncommunity meets.\nI think back to when I was in Kildare Diocese. At that time there was a radical\nlook at the number of buildings we had in use at that time. This involved a\ncareful consideration of what was the nature of the Church. There was one\nparticular area just south of Mountmellick, around Durrow in Leighlin Diocese,\nwhere an area served by two Roman Catholic Churches was served by five\nChurch of Ireland Churches. When the history of those particular buildings\nwas looked at it was realised that many had their origins in a fashion by owners\nof big houses to each build private chapels for their families and their Church\nof Ireland workers \u2013 there was an element of one upmanship.\nWith demise of the big house, for both political and economic reasons, we\nwere left with buildings without communities \u2013 to be frank some of them never\nhad real communities even when they were built. We also had a distortion of\nspirituality in which the preservation of a particular building became more\nimportant that the worship that was offered in that building.\nPage 3 of 4\nPROPER 11 \u2013 2015 \u2013 year B \u2013 Trinity 7\nWhat is at issue here is the whole matter of identity and where we find that\nidentity. This is the same issue at stake in whether David was to build the\nTemple at that particular point in time. For buildings, even our most beautiful\nand impressive buildings can, if we allow them, distort rather than enhance our\nspiritual pilgrimage. Take the Temple itself; even in its ruins you can see it\nmust have been a magnificent building. Many years after it was finally built by\nSolomon, Jewish spiritual life became a shadow of what it was intended to be.\nWhen the city was besieged and surrounded by enemies, the people assumed\nbecause of the physical presence of the Temple, God would never allow the\ncity to be captured. At that time Ezekiel had his vision of the glory of God\nleaving the Temple and departing the city. In the eyes of the people the\nTemple had become the focus of their identity rather than a faithfulness to the\nGod who was worshipped there. The people had to go through the painful\nexperience of the Exile to rediscover their identity as the People of God.\nWe are now preparing to celebrate the 150th Anniversary of the Consecration of\nour Parish Church and the 200th Anniversary of the Church that was on this site\nbeforehand, the tower of which is incorporated into St Mary\u2019s. We are very\nconscious that we are remembering not just the building of this Church but also\nthe community that has worshipped here over the years. This building is held\nin great affection and as we restore the roof we are preserving this building for\nuse by future generations. But as I remind every confirmation group, this\nbuilding is not the Church. The Church is the community that meets here for\nworship. Or as Bishop Noel Willoughby once said in General Synod, \u2018The\nChurch is what is left when the building has fallen down.\u2019 As so as we prepare\na history of our Parish we are compiling not just a history of this building but\nPage 4 of 4\nPROPER 11 \u2013 2015 \u2013 year B \u2013 Trinity 7\nof the people who have made this Parish what it is \u2013 so we are looking for\nphotographs, for stories, for memorabilia \u2013 so that we can tell the story of who\nwe are as a community.\nAs we prepare to move forward the Vestry are in the process of having a look\nat how we use this building into the future.
