    "blurb": "In this sermon, Kevin uses the metaphor of the letter 'I' crossed out to describe the selfless life of Jesus. He encourages the congregation to model their attitudes and lives on Jesus, living selflessly and obediently. He also brings out the importance of being the 'aroma of Christ' and a 'letter of Christ', living lives that draw people to Christ and are written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God.",
    "raw_text": "Palm Sunday \u2013 we began with the story of Jesus\u2019 entry into Jerusalem. Started with a cheering crowd \u2013 ends with Jesus on the Cross, with his enemies jeering. What happened?\n\nWe will start with keeping things simple. What letter does this represent? (Hold up piece of wood) That letter is quite important to us if you think about it \u2013 we use it a lot.\n\nWe use to express opinions \u2013 \u2018I think Birmingham City are a great football team.\u2019 We use it to express our affection \u2013 we might say to someone \u2018I love you\u2019 We use it to encourage other people \u2013 \u2018I think you are looking great today\u2019; \u2018I think you are really good at doing that\u2019.\n\nBut \u2018I\u2019 is not always so pleasant. We can use it to express prejudice \u2013 \u2018I think foreigners are lazy, or stupid, or dishonest.\u2019 We can use it to express hatred \u2013 \u2018I hate you.\u2019; \u2018I despise you.\u2019\n\nSo the letter \u2018I\u2019 needs to be controlled a bit. In fact sometimes I need to cross the letter \u2018I\u2019 out. (Put cross bar in place and hold up) Now what do I get?\n\nThat\u2019s right a cross \u2013 the cross is, if you like, the letter \u2018I\u2019 crossed out. \u2018I\u2019 crossed out in many ways describes not just the death of Jesus but the whole of his life. That is summed beautifully in those words Paul wrote to the Church at Philippi as he encouraged them to model their attitudes and life on those of Jesus himself.\n\n> Phil2:5-8 Think of yourselves the way Christ Jesus thought of himself. He had equal status with God but didn\u2019t think so much of himself that he had to cling to the advantages of that status no matter what. Not at all. When the time came, he set aside the privileges of deity and took on the status of a slave, became human! Having become human, he stayed human. It was an incredibly humbling process. He didn\u2019t claim special privileges. Instead, he lived a selfless, obedient life and then died a selfless, obedient death\u2014and the worst kind of death at that\u2014a crucifixion.\n\nOn one occasion Jesus told his followers, \u201cIf any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me.\u201d How can we think of taking up our cross daily? We find our example in that selfless obedient life of Jesus, life lived with the \u2018I\u2019 crossed out.\n\nThe idea of life lived \u2018with the I crossed out\u2019 is one that is very relevant to the situation we find ourselves in. But this has to go beyond words or gestures. Paul, in his second letter ot the Corinthians, a Church very much taken up by outward, out of the ordinary signs of the Spirit, used a couple of lovely expressions:\n\n> For we are the aroma of Christ 2 Cor 2:15\n\nI remember when I first arrived in Dublin in the late 60\u2019s, walking up Grafton Street, smelling the most wonderful smell of coffee. In those days, Bewley\u2019s used to roast their coffee beans in the front window of the shop and the fumes were vented out onto the street.\n\nWe are the aroma of Christ, a presence of Christ, a witness to Christ, that goes beyond words, beyond actions. We are called to be the presence of Christ, the \u2018I crossed out\u2019 Christ in the world of today. A presence that draws people in.\n\nThen just a few verses later, another image springs to mind.\n\n> you are a letter of Christ, \u2026.. , written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts. 2 Cor 3:3\n\nIn this electronic age, we don\u2019t write letters so much these days. When I was younger, I used to loved receiving letters, writing letters. Letters from my parents, from friends, courtship letters; letters read not just once but brought out and read and re-read.\n\nA life in which I seek to encourage people rather than undermine them; in which I express love and not hatred, in which we turn our back on prejudice and honour one another.\n\nI will just close with the prayer of St Ignatius which I think gives us a lovely pattern for living in the footsteps of Jesus.\n\n> Teach us, good Lord, to serve thee as thou deservest;\nTo give, and not to count the cost,\nto fight, and not to heed the wounds,\nto toil, and not to seek for rest,\nto labour, and not to ask for any reward,\nsave that of knowing that we do thy will.",
