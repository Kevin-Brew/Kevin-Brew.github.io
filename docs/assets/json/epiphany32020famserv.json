The sermon emphasizes the importance of embodying the fruits of the spirit, and how this can sometimes be challenging. The ultimate goal is to become more like Jesus, shining as lights in the world.",

Couldn\u2019t see the path in front \u2013 couldn\u2019t see the path behind.\n\nLight house also warns of danger \u2013 warns ships to stay off the rocks. Sometimes people set false lights to draw ships onto rocks and then plunder the ship.\n\nImportant that the light house keeps shining in all weathers.\n\nIn our bible reading Jesus says that those who follow him should be like lights \u2013 shouldn\u2019t be afraid to hide our light. Jesus said \u2018I am the light of the world\u2019 He also said that if we follow him, he will live in us and we will live in him.\n\nWe are the ones through whom Jesus shines as a light in the world today.\n\nWhat does that mean? Last Friday, in Assembly in the Burrow, 2nd Class led us through a lovely assembly based on the fruits of the spirit, love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.\n\nThey thought about the difference this can make \u2013 it is not always easy. It\u2019s easy to love someone you like \u2013 but Jesus tells us to love our enemy. Kindness is all very well \u2013 but some people can be very annoying.\n\nAs I listened to all this I thought of one of the definitions of the Holy Spirit that has always appealed to me\n\nThe Holy Spirit enables me to become more like Jesus.\n\nYou and me becoming more like Jesus, you and me shining as lights in the world.\n\nMay God enable each one of us to shine this week, to show something of the love of God in all that we do, all that we say, all that we are.",
