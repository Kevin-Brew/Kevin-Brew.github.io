    "blurb": "Kevin reflects on the anxiety of losing important items like keys and phones, drawing parallels to the parables of the lost sheep and the lost coin. He emphasizes the value and urgency of the search, relating it to God's relentless pursuit of us. The sermon concludes with the message that God's love never gives up on us, and we should respond to that love by caring for one another.",
    "raw_text": "One of the things I dread is losing my keys or my phone. Tracing the phone can be easy enough. Now losing the keys, that can be a different situation \u2013 you know the scene, you are heading out the door, possibly a bit late and you reach for the keys.\n\n'Have you seen my keys?'\n'Where did you put them?'\n'If I knew where I had put them I wouldn't be asking where they are.'\n'No need to shout \u2013 I was only trying to help.'\n\nSo to try and preserve peace and harmony in the house, now, whenever I come back into the house the keys always go onto a particular shelf in the \u2013 well nearly always.\n\nSo why am I looking for my keys? There's a simple answer to that \u2013 they are important to me. So if I lose them, I have to search until I find them. Searching until I find them \u2013 that is what the shepherd leaving behind the 99 was doing as he headed off in search of the one that was lost. That is what the woman was doing as she upended her house in search of the lost coin. There was an urgency to that search \u2013 the lost sheep, the lost coin were important, they were valued and their recovery was an excuse for a party.\n\nSheep, the keeping of sheep, was very important to many of the people who would have been coming to listen to Jesus. They would have known what it was to lose a sheep and how difficult it could be to find it. In John's Gospel we read of Jesus describing himself as the Good Shepherd and he tells his disciples:\n\n> He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice. John 10:3,4\n\nThe shepherd knows his sheep and the sheep recognize the shepherd, recognize his voice.\n\nThere are not many shepherds around the hill of Howth \u2013 but I've something here to do with the keys I have lost. If I go to my phone \u2013 find the right app \u2013 press find \u2013 does anyone hear anything?\n\nThe phone if you like is calling out for my keys \u2013 this tag on my key ring recognized the call and answered \u2013 so I can now get into my house, I can now drive my car.\n\nJesus used the story of people searching for something that was precious to them as an illustration of God searching for us. Like the lost sheep in the story we may wander off, get caught up in lots of things \u2013 not all of these are bad, our sports, our careers \u2013 and something goes missing in our life.\n\nBut God is on the look out for us, he never gives up looking because we are special to him. As one who tried avoiding God for many a year, you can take it from me \u2013 he never gives up. Our Collect of the Day for next Sunday is based on a prayer by another man who kept avoiding God, St Augustine. He drove his Mum to despair with some of the friends he hung around with, some of the bad habits he developed \u2013 but nothing seemed to make him happy. He knew about the God his Mum worshipped but one day he knew God had found him and he found a peace in his heart. Out of this experience we have this prayer:\n\nAlmighty God,\nyou have made us for yourself,\nand our hearts are restless till they find their rest in you:\nTeach us to offer ourselves to your service,\nthat here we may have your peace,\nand in the world to come may see you face to face;\nthrough Jesus Christ our Lord.\n\nRemember God loves each and every one of us with a love that never gives up. Let us this coming week respond to that love in our love for one another.",

    "prompt": "Create a detailed black and white pencil drawing that depicts the concept of searching for something valuable. The scene is set in an old study room filled with various objects scattered around: a large antique wooden desk covered with open books, papers, and a vintage globe; a classic armchair; a towering bookshelf brimming with books of different sizes; and a soft beam of light coming through a window, highlighting a set of keys partially hidden under a folded map on the desk. The room should convey a sense of urgency and focus, with a magnifying glass lying next to the map, suggesting the ongoing search. There should be no people or animals in the image, and no religious symbols. The composition should draw the viewer's eye toward the hidden keys, using the play of light and shadow to create a sense of discovery.",
    "summary": "From the sermon provided, the top 4 concepts can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **The Importance of Searching**: This concept is illustrated by the urgency and dedication in searching for lost items, such as keys or a phone, which are important and valuable to the individual. This parallels the biblical stories of the shepherd searching for the lost sheep and the woman searching for the lost coin.\n\n2. **Recognition and Relationship**: The sermon speaks about the relationship between the shepherd and the sheep, emphasizing the sheep's ability to recognize the shepherd's voice. This concept is about knowing and being known, which is a fundamental aspect of relationships and community.\n\n3. **God's Persistent Love**: The sermon uses the metaphor of searching for lost items to describe God's unending search for us, emphasizing that each person is precious to God and that God's love is persistent and never gives up.\n\n4. **Restlessness and Fulfillment**: Inspired by St. Augustine's prayer, this concept addresses the human condition of restlessness and the idea that true peace and fulfillment are found in a relationship with God.\n\nFor a non-religious black and white pencil diagram that can be generated by DALL-E 3, I would select the first concept, **The Importance of Searching**, as it can be represented in a universal and non-religious manner. Here is a detailed prompt for DALL-E 3:\n\nPrompt: \"Create a detailed black and white pencil drawing that depicts the concept of searching for something valuable.
