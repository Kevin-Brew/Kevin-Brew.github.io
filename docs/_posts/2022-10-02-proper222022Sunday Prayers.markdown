Prayers

For the peace that comes from God alone,
for the unity of all peoples,
and for our salvation,
Lord in your mercy
Hear our prayer

For the Church of Christ, for George our Bishop, for this Parish and all churches in this area and for the whole people of God,
Lord in your mercy
Hear our prayer

For the nations of the world, we continue in prayer for the people of Ukraine in their continued suffering. We bring before God the growing uncertainties and the threats to peace. We pray for all who work for peace and justice in the world of today. We pray for Charles our King, for all in authority, for all who are called to leadership in our Province
Lord in your mercy
Hear our prayer

For this area in which we live for our neighbours and our friends,
Lord in your mercy
Hear our prayer

For the good earth which God has given us, and for the wisdom and will to conserve it,
Lord in your mercy
Hear our prayer

For the aged and infirm, for the widowed and orphans, for the sick and suffering, remembering any known to us and for all in any need,
Lord in your mercy
Hear our prayer

For the poor and the oppressed, for the unemployed and the destitute, for prisoners and captives, and for all who remember and care for them,
Lord in your mercy
Hear our prayer

For the dying, for our Rector mourning the death of his mother for the faithful whom we entrust to the Lord in hope, as we look forward to the day when we share the fullness of the resurrection,
Lord in your mercy
Hear our prayer

Rejoicing in the communion of the saints, let us commend ourselves, and one another, and all our life, to God.
