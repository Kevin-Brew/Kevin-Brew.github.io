    "raw_text": "Sixth Sunday of Easter \u2013 2016 \u2013 Year C\n\nJesus said to his disciples: 23\u2018Those who love me will keep my word, and my Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them. John 14:23\n\nA cry that has been heard in many a home down through the years, often from a teenager being told off by a parent is that of, \u201cWould you ever leave me alone?\u201d Many a time we might yearn for solitude amidst the hustle and bustle of every day life \u2013 but few would years for loneliness, the feeling of being utterly alone, the feeling that no-one cares or is interested in our concerns. It is surely no accident that one of the most severe sanctions in the prison system is that of solitary confinement, isolating the individual from all contact with his fellow prisoners.\n\nI would suspect that all of us have experienced loneliness from time to time. Maybe when it was when you started a new school or job \u2013 especially if you have moved in form another district. What a breakthrough it was when we made our fist friends. Then there is the loneliness that comes from suffering \u2013 the breakdown of a relationship. We suddenly feel very alone, very vulnerable. The discovery of illness in ourselves or our partner or someone we love. Then there is the whole trauma of bereavement \u2013 again we fell very alone, very vulnerable.\n\nOn this Sunday before Ascension Day, our Gospel passage this morning is a passage drawn from John\u2019s account of our Lord\u2019s teaching given in the upper room on the night before he died. Jesus is, for want of a better term, saying his goodbyes. The disciples, for their part, were distressed at the thought of what lay ahead \u2013 distressed at the thought of Jesus\u2019 coming suffering, distressed at the thought that their fellowship with him was drawing to a close, at the prospect of loneliness.\n\nJesus is, of course, going to experience loneliness, the dark loneliness of Calvary, His cry of desolation \u2018My God, my God. Why have you abandoned me?\u2019 is a cry from his heart that stirs my own. For me, this cry from the cross lies at the heart of my own understanding of God\u2019s love for me in Christ; the height, the depth, the length, the breadth of God\u2019s redeeming, reconciling love. I come to see that Christ, having given so much will never leave me alone, will never abandon me to loneliness. I may choose to walk away from his love, he will never walk away from me.\n\nAs I thought on that and re-read our Gospel passage, I thought of those closing words of Jesus as we find them in Matthew\u2019s Gospel. He sends his disciples out in his name to make disciples of all nations, promising them, \u201cAnd remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.\" Matt 28.20\n\nWith all this in mind, let us return to our gospel passage. \u2018 \u201cI am going away, and I am coming to you.\u201d The parting will be painful but the return is assured. 23\u2018Those who love me will keep my word, and my Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them. John 14:23\n\nLet us look at the promise that is entailed in this. \u2018my Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them\u2019 Earlier on in this 14th chapter we read of Jesus promising his disciples 3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, so that where I am, there you may be also. John 14:3\n\nThis is a passage that would frequently read at a funeral and would be one of the key texts in our confidence in the face of death.. Here in the passage we read today, he speaks of the Father and the Son coming to lodge with us in this life. This is to be no fleeting visit, this is the Father and the Son living within us through the Holy Spirit. No longer need we be alone, no longer need we experience the loneliness of isolation from God.\n\nThose who love me will keep my word. As I\u2019ve remarked before, in the Greek in which the New Testament is written there are a number of words that we translate by our single word \u2018love\u2019, ranging from the sensual, through friendship to the spiritual. The word used here is agapw. This is a love that is focussed on the interests and needs of the one being loved. It is a self giving love, a love marked by a total self surrender. A mark of my self surrender to Christ is my willingness to put myself at his command, at his disposal as I seek, albeit imperfectly,, to do his will in what I say, in what I do, in what I think.\n\nNow I am still human, I am still weak, and I don\u2019t always get it right \u2013 but my desire is to serve him.\n\nThen as I move towards God in love and obedience, so the Father moves towards me in love.\n\nand my Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them.\n\nAgain, the word used here for love is that self same agapw. It is a love that seeks our the very best for me and in me. As we have already noted, this is not love at a distance, this is love in residence, the Father and the Son who gave himself for me dwelling in me through the Holy Spirit. Secure in his love, I am enabled to grow in my love and obedience for him.\n\nTeach us, good Lord, to serve thee as thou deservest;\n\nTo give, and not to count the cost,\n\nto fight, and not to heed the wounds,\n\nto toil, and not to seek for rest,\n\nto labour, and not to ask for any reward,\n\nsave that of knowing that we do thy will.\n\nPrayer of St Ignatius",

    "summary": "From the sermon provided, the top four concepts appear to be:\n\n1. **The Promise of Divine Presence**: The idea that Jesus and the Father will come and make their home with those who love and keep Jesus' word, suggesting a constant divine presence that alleviates loneliness.\n\n2. **Loneliness and Isolation**: The sermon discusses the human experience of loneliness, the pain of being alone, and the various situations in life that can lead to such feelings, contrasting it with the promise of divine companionship.\n\n3. **Love and Obedience**: The concept of 'agape' love, a selfless, sacrificial love that is focused on the well-being of others, and the idea that love for Jesus is demonstrated through keeping his word and living in obedience to his teachings.\n\n4. **Eternal Assurance and Comfort**: The sermon touches on the assurance of eternal life and comfort in the face of death, as Jesus promises to prepare a place for believers and to be with them always.\n\nFor a non-religious black and white pencil diagram that can be represented graphically without text, the concept of \"The Promise of Divine Presence\" could be depicted in a way that focuses on the abstract notion of presence and companionship without specific religious symbolism.\n\n**Detailed Prompt for DALL-E 3:**\n\n\"Create a black and white pencil drawing that depicts the abstract concept of an ever-present companionship in a comforting and non-religious setting.
