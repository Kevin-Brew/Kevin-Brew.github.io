He emphasizes that we are all unique creations of God and that we are all made in God's image. He encourages us to appreciate and marvel at God's creation and to understand our purpose in life as God's children.",

Don\u2019t we live in a beautiful place \u2013 the sea and the waves, the walk round the hill of Howth, the views over the Dublin mountains, all the different plants and birds. Have you ever stopped to look at how amazing this world is \u2013 we can be so busy rushing around we don\u2019t even see it. The fellow who wrote our Psalm this morning probably felt a bit like that \u2013 he\u2019s basically saying \u2018Stop \u2013 just look around you, take it all in and marvel at what you see and the God who made it all.\u2019\n\nAt the beginning of the service I gave some people a lump of play dough and asked them to make something \u2013 shall we see what they have come up with. All so different \u2013 God who made us has given us eyes, hand, fingers, to enable us to make things. Sometimes we talk of self expression in what we write, we draw or paint \u2013 in the musical instruments we play, in the songs we sing \u2013 in other words something of us, our character, our nature comes out.\n\nI am now going to give some people a little hand mirror \u2013 I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s not one for everyone in the audience \u2013 maybe ladies if you have one in your handbag, just take it out. Look at your eyes, your nose \u2013 who are you like? They say I have my Dad\u2019s face \u2013 and also my Mum\u2019s big toe \u2013 there\u2019s something of our parents, our grandparents in each one of us.\n\nBut the Bible says there is more to us than that \u2013 we are made in God\u2019s image \u2013 that marks us out form the rest of God\u2019s creation. We are part of God\u2019s self expression. I was born a member of the Brew family \u2013 as I have grown up, I\u2019ve learned what it is to be a member of the Brew family, what it is to be a Brew. As I have grown in my Christian faith, I have learned more and more of what it is to be a member of God\u2019s family, what it is to be made in the image of God. At the heart of my learning what it is to be made in the image of God is the person of Jesus Christ. as we read in our second lesson\n\nWe look at this Son and see the God who cannot be seen. We look at this Son and see God\u2019s original purpose in everything created. In Jesus I see the person I should be, the person God intended me to be \u2013 but more than that, much more than that, I see in Jesus the height, the depth, the breadth of God\u2019s love for me, in his life, his teaching, his death and resurrection, leading me back to him \u2013 to love and to serve him every day of my life.\n\nTake one last look at yourself \u2013 you are a child of God, loved by God, made for his service.",
