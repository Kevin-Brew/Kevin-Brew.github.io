    "blurb": "In this sermon, Kevin shares the story of a dwindling parish near Wall Street that was revitalized through a simple act of service: providing affordable lunches to office workers. He draws parallels between this story and the biblical account of Jesus feeding the five thousand, emphasizing the power of small, seemingly insignificant gifts offered in faith. He encourages his congregation to recognize and offer their own gifts, however small, for the building up of God's Kingdom.",
    "raw_text": "I recall early on in the days of my ministry attending a Diocesan clergy conference in Dublin. The speaker that year was a Rector from a Parish in New York. He told of how he had been appointed to a dwindling parish not far from Wall Street, the home of the American Stock Market. He had been given the job of nursing the Parish through the painful process of closure. Before embarking on that, conscious of the Church\u2019s proximity to Wall Street, he decided to explore possibilities of development of a weekday ministry to the people working in the offices in that part of New York.\n\nSo, one Sunday morning he shared his thoughts with members of his Parish and asked people to come forward with offers of gifts of service. At the end of the service one lady nervously approached him saying that she didn\u2019t think she could be of much use, but she did have a talent for producing tasty food cheaply. Initially they both laughed and then the Rector stopped. Here they were on the edge of Wall Street full of people working in offices who could be interested in lunches produced at an attractive price.\n\nAnd that is what they started to do. They produced lunches at an attractive price and people started coming to the Parish Hall for lunch. Initially there was no preaching \u2013 the Church was simply offering a service. And then people started taking an interest in what the Church was doing. Up to then it had just been a closed-up building that they had walked past on their way to and from work. And from their questions a ministry started that grew and the church gained new life both during the week and at the weekend.\n\nA small, apparently inconsequential gift, offered in faith in the service of the Church producing results, the re-energising of a Parish that was set for closure. I leave that thought with you as we go on to reflect on our Gospel reading for today. As Matthew puts together his Gospel, this account of the feeding of the five thousand is set in a wider context of teaching, of the stilling of the storm, of healing in which Jesus is presented to his readers as one having authority over sickness, over the powers of nature, one who teaches with authority.\n\nToday I just want to focus on this particular story of the feeding of the five thousand, and in particular the disciples\u2019 reaction to Jesus telling them to give the crowd something to eat.\n\n15When it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, \u2018This is a deserted place, and the hour is now late; send the crowds away so that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves.\u2019 16Jesus said to them, \u2018They need not go away; you give them something to eat.\u2019 17They replied, \u2018We have nothing here but five loaves and two fish.\u2019\n\nMatt 14:15-17\n\nWe have nothing here.\n\nWe have nothing here \u2026but.\n\nThe mind set is fixed on the enormity of the problem and not on the resources to hand. Also, as you read and reread the story, the Gospel writers have not left us a story of Jesus producing food out of thin air. It is a story of Jesus taking the resources to hand and working in and through them to meet the needs of the crowd; \u2018and all eat and were filled\u2019. This is not just food to fill a gap, this is a meal that satisfies.\n\nAs we look through the Bible, we see time and time again, stories of God taking the weak and insignificant and working in and through them. We hear of an old man Abram and his wife Sarai, both too old to have children, being uprooted from their homeland and settled in a small insignificant place with a promise of children. A story unfolds of Patriarchs, of Judges and of Kings in all their strengths and weaknesses, their faithfulness, and their failure \u2013 God works in and through them.\n\nIn the Incarnation, we experience God coming to us in a child born in a stable, who comes not as a long anticipated military Messiah but one preaching a message of reconciliation, of turning the other cheek, going the second mile; reaching out to leper, to tax collector, to sinner, to those in deep emotional turmoil. One who dies a humiliating and seemingly pointless death; a death that has spoken to men and women across all cultures, times and places of God\u2019s amazing, God\u2019s incomprehensible love.\n\nAll he asks in return is our love, our tentative, imperfect love, faith, commitment. I often find myself thinking the late Brother Roger founder of the Ecumenical Community of Taize. He would speak of mustard seed faith, God taking the littleness of our understanding, our service and love and working through them.\n\nYou may recall that Martin was talking of mustard seed faith last Sunday; that when life is hard, when life is giving us lots of knocks; times when it is hard to praise God \u2013 there is that residue of faith that keeps us going. That is what God works through to achieve his purposes in ways we can often hardly imagine.\n\nAs Martin was talking about that, he also spoke of this place, of COGS; the way this place has evolved through the strengths and weaknesses of former clergy and people. Speaking as an outsider, I can say that there is something special about this place; there is a warmth of welcome, there is an inclusiveness that you don\u2019t see in all churches. At the minute you are at an in between stage \u2013 we\u2019ve said farewell to Ruth, thankful for all that she brought to this place in her ministry here. And we are not sure who is coming next. For those of you who have been brought up in the Methodist tradition, this is something strange. You are used to saying goodbye to one minister one Sunday and seeing the new one the following Sunday. For those of you brought up in the Church of Ireland this is quite normal. There are strengths and weaknesses to both systems. You can see the period without a minister as a threat or as an opportunity.\n\nAfter I left the Parish of Mountmellick in County Laois, there was a gap of 12 months (No-one is suggesting that there is going to be a 12 month gap here \u2013 there were particular reasons for the 12 month gap in Mountmellick). I recall meeting a lay reader in the Parish shortly after my successor was appointed. I\u2019ll never forget what he said to me. \u2018Don\u2019t take this the wrong way Kevin but the 12 months we had without you was probably the best thing ever happened to Mountmellick. You had been telling us to use and offer our gifts \u2013 it was only when you weren\u2019t there that we saw what you were talking about.\u2019\n\nThis Church is full of gifted people. You may think that your gift is not that significant. But the lesson for today is that God can take the small and seemingly insignificant and use it in the building up of his Kingdom in this place.\n\nJust as he took the littleness of loaves and fishes to feed a crowd, just as he took the littleness of the offering of that lady in New York to set in train a whole ministry, so God will take the likes of even you and me, the littleness, the inadequacy of our love and service. We discover the meaning of that little word \u2018grace\u2019; we discover that it doesn\u2019t in fact all depend on me, simply my response to God\u2019s amazing, empowering love.\n\nJesu, Jesu, I thee adore; help me love thee more and more.",

    "main_concepts": {
        "Gifts of Service": "The concept of offering gifts of service is highlighted through the story of a woman's simple offering of her talent for producing tasty food, which led to the revitalization of a parish near Wall Street. This act of service, though initially seen as inconsequential, sparked a ministry that brought new life to the church.",
        "Faith and Provision": "The sermon draws parallels between the biblical story of the feeding of the five thousand and the modern example of the parish near Wall Street. It emphasizes the idea that even when resources seem scarce, faith and a focus on what is available can lead to miraculous provision and fulfillment.",
        "Utilizing Gifts During Transition": "The speaker encourages the congregation to see the period without a minister not as a threat but as an opportunity to utilize their gifts. The story of a lay reader realizing the importance of using their gifts during a 12-month gap in leadership at a parish in Mountmellick serves as an example of how periods of transition can be transformative."
