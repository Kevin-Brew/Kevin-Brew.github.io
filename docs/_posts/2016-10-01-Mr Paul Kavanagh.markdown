Funeral of Paul (PK) Kavanagh – 1st October 2016 – St Mary’s

Last weekend Paul Kavanagh (PK to his friends) had travelled North with his son Max for a sailing event. It was a trip that was to end in his sudden death leaving his family and his friends shocked and saddened. Paul had grown up in Finglas. He had set up his own business, Apollo Blinds, and in time had come to live on the Dublin Road in Sutton. Here he and Jill raised their two lads Alex and Max. His own family moved to Australia but Paul chose to stay here, maintaining close contacts over the years. The family speak of PK’s three great passions in life; sailing, which he took to in his 20’s, rugby and the lads.

His death in Northern Ireland last Sunday struck everyone out of the blue. It was all so sudden. That suddenness can catch us all off balance. There are no chances for goodbyes; it sharpens our awareness of loss; something in us still cannot believe this has happened. A funeral, a memorial service provides us with an occasion to reflect.

We come to set the mystery of death in the context of our Christian faith. I begin with Easter, with life triumphant over death that lies at the heart of our faith, that we celebrate in the Eucharist Sunday by Sunday. In our Gospel reading, Jesus, speaking to the disciples on the eve of his Passion, talks of separation. Separation, bereavement, is always difficult, always painful.

> Do not let your hearts be troubled: trust in God, trust also in me …… that where I am, there you may also be …… 27Peace I leave with you, my peace I give you. I do not give as the world gives. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid

In all this, as the Gospels unfold the story of Jesus I am reminded that we follow a Lord who knows what death, what suffering, what loss is all about; one who knew what it was like to weep and the grave of his friend Lazarus. Not only that, he is the one who was raised triumphant over death, breaking the power of death itself.

On this day, as we have come to thank God for the life of Paul, of PK Kavanagh and the love we have shared with him, we have come also to offer our love and support to those who will miss her most. May you, the family and friends of Paul Kavanagh know something of the presence of Christ in these coming days and in his presence come to know something of his peace.
