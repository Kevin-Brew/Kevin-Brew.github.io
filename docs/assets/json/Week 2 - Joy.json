    "blurb": "In this sermon, Kevin explores the concept of joy as a fruit of the Spirit. He discusses the importance of harmony with God and our neighbours, and how joy is a deeper emotion that arises from love experienced in Christ. He also emphasizes that joy is a gift from God, not something we can manufacture ourselves.",
    "raw_text": "Fruit of the Spirit (2) - Joy\n\nStart with Reading of Galatians 5\n\nOver this particular Lent, we are centring our thoughts around what Paul describes in this letter to the Galatians as the fruits of the Spirit. Outworkings that we should expect to see in ourselves of our faith in Christ.\n\nAlbeit that Good Works, which are the fruits of Faith, and follow after Justification, cannot put away our sins, and endure the severity of God's judgment; yet are they pleasing and acceptable to God in Christ, and do spring out necessarily of a true and lively Faith insomuch that by them a lively Faith may be as evidently known as a tree discerned by the fruit. Article 12 (BCP 2004 p 781)\n\nAs with last week, set all this in the context of the teaching of the Revised Catechism of the Church of Ireland on the work of the Holy Spirit\n\nThe Holy Spirit enables me to grow in likeness to Jesus Christ.\n\nSo when last week we looked at love, we first thought about how we find it in Jesus and God\n\nAs we experience the healing reconciling love so we begin to show it.\n\nA love that took the initiative\nthat knows no boundaries - even our enemies\nthat does not calculate the cost \u2013 My God, My God \u2026..\n\nWe become not just a people who pray but a people who do.\n\nTonight think of joy \u2013 follows on from love.\n\nJust begin with ordinary human relationships as exemplified in the picture of the return of the Prodigal.\n\nThere had been a breakdown in relationships \u2013 we all know the outcome of that \u2013 there can be tension, hurt, pain \u2013 in ordinary human situations there can be an element of revenge.\n\nChange in atmosphere when that argument, that division is resolved.\n\nIn the picture \u2013 the son had set off home \u2013 the father had been waiting ready to welcome him on his return.\n\nThere is both joy and pain \u2013 harmony and disharmony.\n\nLike \u2018love\u2019, \u2018joy\u2019 is another that occurs right through the Bible.\n\nAn emotion of harmony \u2013 harmony with God, harmony with our neighbour\n\nPsalms - Jubilate \u2018O be joyful in the Lord\u2019 \u2013 joy in the presence of God\n\nPsalm 119:11 Your decrees are my heritage forever;\nthey are the joy of my heart.\n\nIn Old Testament, experience of judgement involves a banishing of joy\n\nJeremiah 7:34 34 And I will bring to an end the sound of mirth and gladness,\nthe voice of the bride and bridegroom in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; for the land shall become a waste.\n\nBy the same token, the experience of redemption, the restoration of harmony, gives rise to joy \u2013 passages in Isaiah\n\n11 So the ransomed of the LORD shall return,\nand come to Zion with singing;\neverlasting joy shall be upon their heads;\nthey shall obtain joy and gladness,\nand sorrow and sighing shall flee away.

But when her child is born, she no longer remembers the anguish because of the joy of having brought a human being into the world. 22 So you have pain now; but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you. John 16:20-22\n\nNot something we manufacture from within \u2013 it is gift \u2013 in the picture the son\u2019s joy is a gift of the father.\n\nJoy is gift of God, God working in and through us\n\nArising out of love experienced in Christ \u2013 work of HS enabling to grow in likeness to Christ..\n\nMay each of us be enabled to receive the love that is showered upon us; may the Holy Spirit that he promised continue to work in us, enabling us to become more like Jesus Christ. Becoming more like him, may our lives demonstrate something of the love, the joy that is in him \u2013 so that by the albeit imperfect witness of our lives, others may be drawn into his kingdom.",
