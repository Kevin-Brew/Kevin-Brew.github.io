    "blurb": "In this sermon, Kevin explores the concept of God's purpose in creation and the idea of providence. He addresses the problem of evil and suffering in the world, and how these challenges can be faced with faith. The sermon emphasizes on the power of resurrection and the peace that comes from God's solidarity in suffering.",
    "raw_text": "When we think about creation in religious terms our minds turn inevitably to the two creation narratives that make up the first two chapters of Genesis. Around these passages have sprung up all the debates about creationism, Darwinism, the apparent conflict between religious faith and scientific enquiry. The Bible has a lot more to say on this subject \u2013 there is the whole Wisdom tradition that we find in books such as the Psalms, the Book Proverbs.\n\nI often find myself reflecting on Psalm 8, the psalmist standing in awe at the majesty of creation, amazed that God would have anything to do with mere man. In our Old Testament Lesson, there is a reflection on Wisdom present at creation, participating in creation that ties in with the opening verses of our Gospel reading, \u2018In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning.\u2019 (John 1:1)\n\nOur thoughts here are being drawn beyond the mere fact of creation, beyond speculation about the mechanics of creation \u2013 evolution, big bang, Darwin or Genesis - to the issue that lies at the heart of all the Biblical material, that of purpose; \u2018What is man that God is mindful of him?\u2019\n\nWith purpose comes the idea of providence, that God has a continuing interest in this world that he has made. The Bible explores this through the story, the history of a particular people. The Hebrews understood their history as the working out of a destiny to which God had called Abraham and his descendants; that history is understood as a covenant history, through which God guided his people towards their destiny.\n\nIt is a picture of God working through history. Joseph abandoned into slavery by jealous conniving brothers becomes the instrument of their preservation. Then of course there are the events of a people\u2019s Exodus from Egypt; scarcely mentioned in Egyptian annals yet crucial in the Jewish people\u2019s understanding of who they are before God. The opening chapter of St John\u2019s Gospel, that we read from this morning, expresses the Christian conviction that what was begun in the call of Abraham finds its culmination in the coming of Christ.\n\nBut this picture of God\u2019s purposes in creation, God\u2019s providence brings us face to face with the problem of evil, of suffering. What do we say in the face of the suffering we see on our television screens \u2013 be they the results of natural disaster or human conflict? Or just the crises we face in our own lives; illness in ourselves or a loved one \u2013 where is God in all of this?\n\nI often recall one of our lecturers in college remarking that we often feel that we have to be so polite to God in the face of evil. He contrasted this to the writer of the Psalms and books such as the Book of Job in which the problem of evil was addressed with nothing less than a passion. As I thought about this I went back to a book by Bishop David Jenkins, \u2018Free to Believe\u2019.\n\n\u2018Belief in God is always challenged. There is always a question-mark about which wins \u2013 faith or nonsense. Sometimes the question-mark goes down in the same sort of desperation, despair and nonsense that Jesus faced on the cross. Then I am reminded that the writer of the Book of Job had the same question-mark and practically swore at God. Jesus in his desperate cry on the Cross experienced the same question-mark. I find again and again that, in a very glorious and strange way, the question-mark suddenly changes into an exclamation-mark about the glory of God and triumph of love. The hell business in life of much-loved children dying, of the sufferings of famine, bereavement, loneliness \u2013 the shouting at God \u2013 it all echoes the desolation of the Cross. In Jesus we are reminded that bang out of the middle of this despair is where Resurrection explodes, the Holy Spirit is given and there is power to go on living.\u2019 (Free to Believe p 67)\n\nWe began by thinking of God\u2019s purposes in creation and the whole concept of providence, the whole idea of God working in and through the developing history of his creation. In the context of the Biblical story, working through from the call of Abraham, the ups and downs of the covenant history through to the coming of Christ.\n\nBut any thoughts of God\u2019s purpose inevitably bring us up against the problem of evil, of suffering in the world; those question marks mentioned by Bishop David Jenkins, questions that have to be faced. I begin to find the answer in the very question itself and in the mystery of the incarnation, the passion, the death and resurrection of Jesus. In place of God\u2019s apparent absence, I experience something of God\u2019s solidarity as one who experienced in himself the darkness, the pain and desolation of Calvary, and in that solidarity come to find something of his peace.",
