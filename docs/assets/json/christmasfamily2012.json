There is a story of a 4th wise man called Arteban, a friend of the other three, story has it he was a very clever, very compassionate doctor.\n\nPlan was for Arteban to travel with the other three to visit the King \u2013 he was going to bring jewels, diamond, ruby and a pearl. He was always late \u2013 but for a very good reason \u2013 on his way to meet them he came across a sick man by the roadside \u2013 he stopped to look after him until he was better \u2013 but friends went on without him.\n\nNeeded to organise his own transport \u2013 to hire a camel train he had to sell one of his jewels \u2013 most beautiful pearl \u2013 at least I will have the other two to give to the King.\n\nArrived in Bethlehem \u2013 late \u2013 the family had gone \u2013 story had it to Egypt \u2013 he stayed in a house for the night planning to follow. During the night he awakened to a sound of shouting and screaming \u2013 soldiers had come to the town with orders to kill every baby under two \u2013 there was a baby in the house \u2013 then there was a hammering on the door \u2013 Arteban told the family to stay very quiet \u2013 he went to the door \u2013 a soldier was there, his sword dripping with blood \u2013 Arteban took the ruby out of his pocket and waved it under the nose of the soldier \u2013 the soldier grinned with greed, took the jewel and left \u2013 he now only had his diamond \u2013 but at least the child was safe and he still had his diamond to give to the King.\n\nHe went on down into Egypt \u2013 looked for the family but never found them. Spent the next 30 years working as a doctor until he decided he would like to spent his last years at home.\n\nStill with the diamond in his pocket he travelled home through Jerusalem - arrived at time of Passover \u2013 great excitement \u2013 there was crucifixion on \u2013 one of the victims sounded like the King he had been seeking \u2013 thought I could buy his life with the diamond.\n\nOn his way out of the city came across a slave girl being chased by a gang of men \u2013 hid behind him \u2013 they ordered him to get out of the way. She was hers and they were going to deal with her. Reached into his pocket \u2013 took out the diamond \u2013 gave it to the men and said 'She is now mine \u2013 leave her alone.\u2019 Turned to the girl and said 'You are now free\u2019\n\nNow no gifts left \u2013 wandered sadly back into town \u2013 earthquake \u2013 hit by rubble \u2013 fell to the ground \u2013 crowd gathered round, heard him mumbling 'Lord when did I see you sick, or hungry, or in prison and visit you?\u2019\n\nVoice seemed to come from heaven 'As much as you did it to the least of these brothers of mine you did it to me.\u2019 Arteban smiled and died knowing that the King had received his gifts.",

    "prompt": "Create a black and white pencil sketch that depicts a compassionate, elderly doctor in ancient attire, reminiscent of a wise man from the East, kneeling beside a sick man lying by the roadside in a desert landscape. The doctor is offering a cup of water to the sick man, and a camel can be seen waiting patiently in the background, symbolizing the journey that the doctor has paused. In the sky above, a single bright star shines down on the scene, casting a gentle light over the two figures, emphasizing the moment of selfless care and sacrifice. The doctor's expression is one of deep concern and kindness, while the sick man shows a faint smile of gratitude. No religious symbols or text should be present, just the pure human connection and the act of giving aid to another in need.",
    "summary": "From the sermon text provided, here are the top 4 concepts:\n\n1. Compassion and Sacrifice: Arteban's consistent choice to help others at the cost of his own plans, including selling his pearl to hire a camel and giving away his jewels to save lives.\n2. The Quest for Meaning: Arteban's lifelong journey to present his gifts to the King, which ultimately becomes a metaphor for seeking a life of purpose and significance.\n3. The Value of Human Life: Arteban's actions demonstrate that the value of a single human life is worth more than the most precious jewels.\n4. The Unexpected Fulfillment: Arteban's realization that his acts of kindness were, in fact, gifts to the King, aligning with the teaching that service to others is service to the divine.\n\nFor a non-religious black and white pencil diagram that can be graphically represented, the concept of \"Compassion and Sacrifice\" seems most suitable. It is a universal theme that can be depicted without religious symbols and can resonate with a broad audience.\n\nHere is a detailed prompt for DALL-E 3 to create an image for the concept of \"Compassion and Sacrifice\":\n\n\"Create a black and white pencil sketch that depicts a compassionate, elderly doctor in ancient attire, reminiscent of a wise man from the East, kneeling beside a sick man lying by the roadside in a desert landscape.
