I remember my first Christmas Family Service here in Howth. The buzz around the Church packed with people. Many, and not just the children, had brought at least one of their Christmas presents. It is a lovely way to start our Christmas celebrations, gathering in Church to remember the one who is at the heart of celebrations. It is a very different Christmas this year but it is lovely to see you on screen. That first Family Service I set up a birthday cake at the front of the Church, lit a candle and invited someone up to blow it out – of course as soon as the young fellow turned his back to go back to his seat the candle lit up again.

This little video clip is the closest I can do on a Zoom service; a light that doesn’t go out, a light that keeps on shining however often we put it out. We have heard the story of the birth of Jesus. In the birth of Jesus, God lit a light that hasn’t gone out. When he grew up, people tried to get rid of him. On that first Good Friday they thought they had got rid of him. The light shines in the darkness.
