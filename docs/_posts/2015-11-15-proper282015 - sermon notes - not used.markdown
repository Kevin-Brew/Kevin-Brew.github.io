2 Samuel 15:29-30 describes a poignant scene of David ascending the Mount of Olives in mourning, setting a precedent for this location's significance. Similarly, in Matthew 26:29, Jesus speaks of a future communion in the Father's kingdom, a promise reiterated in Mark 14:25 about not drinking the fruit of the vine until in God's kingdom.

Ezekiel 11:23 and Zechariah 14:3-4 prophesy the glory of the LORD and the Lord's battle, respectively, with the Mount of Olives as a focal point. The Gospels of Matthew and Mark recount Jesus' approach to Jerusalem, his instructions to his disciples regarding a colt, and the events leading to his betrayal and Peter's denial, all within the vicinity of the Mount of Olives.

Luke's account in chapters 19 and 21 highlights Jesus' entry into Jerusalem and his teachings at the temple, with nights spent on the Mount of Olives. Finally, Luke 22:39 captures Jesus' prayer on the Mount of Olives, urging his disciples to pray against temptation.

Every day, Jesus taught in the temple and retreated to the Mount of Olives at night, as described in Luke 21:37-38. This rhythm of teaching and reflection underscores the Mount's role as a place of spiritual significance.
