He draws parallels between the biblical narrative and contemporary issues of justice and racial equality, highlighting the tension between worldly demands and Christian discipleship. The sermon concludes with a call to bring our whole selves to God for healing and service.",
    "raw_text": "Proper 10 \u2013 2012 \u2013 year B \u2013 Trinity 6\n\nOver the last couple of weeks, we have been treated to the rather unedifying spectacle of the trial of an English footballer for racial abuse on the field of play. The individual in question has been found not guilty but will face further proceedings by the football authorities. At the heart of it all was a very public row in which things were said that should be totally unacceptable in any civilised society.\n\nOur Gospel reading, which includes St Mark\u2019s account of the death of John the Baptist, is a story of a powerful man trapped by his own vanity and weakness. Rather than lose face in front of his guests, he feels trapped into fulfilling the request made by a pretty woman to whom he has made a rash promise. In the process, John the Baptist falls victim to human frailty, human sin, manifesting itself in the vanity of Herod.\n\nThis is a reminder that our Christian witness, our Christian service does not happen in isolation; it is offered in the context of our life in the wider world. This is a world that operates under very different value systems. It is a reminder that, even in a society that would describe itself as Christian, the Kingdom of God and the Kingdom of this world are not identical; they may at times be at odds with each other.\n\nBut of course, it is easy to point the finger at others. The more I think about this story of Herod and John the Baptist and its setting in the wider story told to us by St Mark\u2019s Gospel, the more I come to realize that we are ourselves a bundle of ambiguities. In our daily living, we find ourselves caught between the demands of the Kingdom of God and the demands of the world; caught between our own aspirations to Christian discipleship, Christian service, and our own frailty.\n\n> \"So I find it to be a law that when I want to do what is good, evil lies close at hand. For I delight in the law of God in my inmost self, but I see in my members another law at war with the law of my mind, making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members. Wretched man that I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!\" (Rom 7:21-25)\n\nLike Paul, I must accept the reality of that tension within me; and I bring the whole of my being, the good and the bad, the light and the dark, the strong and the frail, the attractive and the ugly; I bring it all into the presence of God and I offer the whole of my being in the service of God.\n\nThere is a prayer that I would often use around Passiontide and Holy Week:\n\n> \"O Jesus, Master Carpenter of Nazareth, who on the cross through wood and nails didst work man\u2019s whole salvation; Wield well thy tools in this thy workshop; that we who come to thee rough hewn may by thy hand be fashioned to a truer beauty and a greater usefulness; for the honour of thy name.\"\n\nThat in itself is a prayer for Christian healing and restoration.\n\nGod is a God who can work in and through our inner tensions and ambiguities. I take encouragement from the way the writer of St Mark\u2019s Gospel has set out his material. Either side of the tragic and pointless death of John, something wonderful is happening in the lives of twelve ordinary men as they are sent out in the service of Christ and return with wonderful news of all that has happened on their journey. We are witnessing the beginnings of the Christian Church which has outlasted the Herods, the Neros, the Hitlers, and the Stalins of this world.\n\nMay God take each one of us in all our weakness and imperfection:\n\n> \"that we who come to thee rough hewn may by thy hand be fashioned to a truer beauty and a greater usefulness;\"\n\nthat God\u2019s name may be honoured and advanced in our lives.",

The individual in question has been found not guilty but will face further\nproceedings by the football authorities. At the heart of it all was a very public\nrow in which things were said that should be totally unacceptable in any\ncivilised society. What is all the more troubling is the realisation that this is far\nfrom an isolated example of irresponsible and unacceptable behaviour by\nhighly paid professional sportsmen who are often taken as role models for\nyounger people. A very public example of how human frailty, human sin can\nbreak through into life, undermining events, undermining relationships.\nOur Gospel reading, which includes St Mark\u2019s account of the death of John\nthe Baptist, is a story of a powerful man trapped by his own vanity and\nweakness. Rather than lose face in front of his guests, he feels trapped into\nfulfilling the request made by a pretty woman to whom he has made a rash\npromise. In the process, John the Baptist falls victim to human frailty, human\nsin, manifesting itself in the vanity of Herod.\nIt is interesting at this point to step back and look at the overall setting of this\nstory in the Gospel according to St Mark. It is an example of how the way the\nindividual writers select and lay out their material tells its own wider story. In\nthis case St Mark has set his account of the death of John the Baptist between\nthe account of Jesus sending out the disciples in pairs on their own ministry\nand that of their return with news of their successes.\nPage 2 of 3\nProper 10 \u2013 2012 \u2013 year B \u2013 Trinity 6\nThis is a reminder that our Christian witness, our Christian service does not\nhappen in isolation; it is offered in the context of our life in the wider world.\nThis is a world that operates under very different value systems. It is a\nreminder that , even in a society that would describe itself as Christian, the\nKingdom of God and the Kingdom of this world are not identical; they may at\ntimes be at odds with each other. This is why messages of reconciliation in\nareas of conflict; calls for justice for the poor, relief of debt, establishment of\nfair trade regimes for producers in the 3rd world, demands for racial equality in\nSouth Africa in times of Apartheid have each in their own time been treated\nwith scorn by those in positions of power. They may not be in a position to lop\noff heads and serve them up on a platter any more but they will certainly try to\ndiscredit and vilify those who challenge the norms of contemporary society.\nBut of course it is easy to point the finger at others. The more I think a bout\nthis story of Herod and John the Baptist and its setting in the wider story told to\nus by St Mark\u2019s Gospel, the more I come to realise that we are ourselves a\nbundle of ambiguities. In our daily living we find ourselves caught between\nthe demands of the Kingdom of god and the demands of the world; caught\nbetween our own aspirations to Christian discipleship, Christian service and\nour own frailty.\nThis inner tension, with which we can all identify, is articulated in St Paul\u2019s\nwords in his letter to the Church at Rome:\n21 So I find it to be a law that when I want to do what is good, evil lies\nclose at hand. 22 For I delight in the law of God in my inmost self, 23\nbut I see in my members another law at war with the law of my mind,\nmaking me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members. 24\nWretched man that I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?\n25 Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! (Rom 7:21-25)\nLike Paul, I must accept the reality of that tension within me; and I bring the\nwhole of my being, the good and the bad, the light and the dark, the strong and\nPage 3 of 3\nProper 10 \u2013 2012 \u2013 year B \u2013 Trinity 6\nthe frail, the attractive and the ugly; I bring it all into the presence of God and I\noffer the whole of my being in the service of God.\nThere is a prayer that I would often use around Passiontide and Holy Week:\nO Jesus, Master Carpenter of Nazareth, who on the cross through wood\nand nails didst work man\u2019s whole salvation; Wield well thy tools in\nthis thy workshop; that we who come to thee rough hewn may by they\nhand be fashioned to a truer beauty and a greater usefulness; for the\nhonour of thy name.\u2019\nThat in itself is a prayer for Christian healing and restoration.\nGod is a God who can work in and through our inner tensions and ambiguities.\nI take encouragement from the way the writer of St Mark\u2019s Gospel has set out\nhis material.
