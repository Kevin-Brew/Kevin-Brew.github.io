    "raw_text": "Rector's Address\n\nIn his address, the Rector reviewed the recent past of the Parish. He noted that the Parish, as it approaches the 150th Anniversary of the Consecration of St Mary's, is in a period of transition. In the past year, the Parish had mourned the passing of several faithful members and had experienced a decline in attendance at some of our morning services and reduction in our income. The continued strength of the Youth Worker Programme under the leadership of Elke Koker was noted. The development of the Family Service and the role of the singing group were welcomed, as they enabled a wider range of music at this service. The reintroduction of the Sunday School under the leadership of Elke Koker, assisted by parents, and the level of support it received was also highlighted.\n\nAs we move into the next era in the history of our parish, the need for younger families to engage and take up the roles played by the older generation was emphasized. The Rector thanked the various people who have worked so hard in a voluntary capacity in the service of the Parish. He concluded his address by announcing that Mr Denis Headon had agreed to act as Rector's Church Warden for the coming year and that Stephen Shaw had agreed to act as Rector's Glebe Warden.",
