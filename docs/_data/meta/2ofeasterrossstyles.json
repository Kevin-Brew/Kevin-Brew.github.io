    "blurb": "The sermon discusses the importance of faith and belief, using the story of Doubting Thomas as a key example. It highlights how our society is often reliant on visual evidence to believe in something, and how this can be a weakness. The sermon encourages questioning and doubt as a means to strengthen faith and belief.",
    "raw_text": "We live in a world that is dominated by technology. In our lifetimes we have seen the arrival of the mobile phone, the laptop, the pc, the Internet. We have become rapidly used to such innovations and quickly imported them into our lives. My own son is 18 months old. His ability to use mobile phones and remote controls seems amazing to me and I am sure you have seen the same in your children and grandchildren. We truly live in an interactive age with instant news on our phones, flat screen 3D TV\u2019s, films and television streamed on the Internet. We have access to all the information and misinformation in the world with just the click of a mouse key. We are constantly bombarded with visual media, ads, special effects and computer generated graphics and games. In our society, seeing is truly believing. And very often if we do not see something ourselves, then we do not believe.\n\nYet this human trait is not just reserved for our present day society. In this morning\u2019s gospel reading from the gospel according to John, chapter 20, beginning at the 19th verse, we see Thomas not believing that Jesus was resurrected because he himself did not witness evidence of Jesus\u2019 resurrection.\n\nBut Thomas (who was called The twin), one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him \u2018 We have seen the Lord.\u2019 But he said to them \u2018Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side, I will not believe. Here is the original doubting Thomas. Thomas will not believe that Jesus has risen unless he sees it himself. As Christians we cannot judge Thomas too harshly as we are prone to this failing. Instead of having faith, we require proof. Many of my friends who are not regular church goers have said those immortal lines \u2018 I believe in something but what proof is there?\u2019 It is a weakness of our society that we feel that we need visual evidence in order to believe. It is a reflection on how the need for empirical data and hard evidence, have come to dominate our society.\n\nThomas is given his hard evidence when Jesus appears to him and the other disciples eight days later.\n\nThen he said to Thomas, \u2018 put your finger here and see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it in my side. Do not doubt but believe.\u2019 Thomas answered him, \u2018my Lord and my God!\u2019 Jesus said to him, \u2018Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe.\u2019\n\nAs we go through our daily lives, our faith can become tested. In our ministries and callings to serve our church, we should remember those words that Jesus spoke to Thomas \u2018Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe.\u2019 We have not seen Jesus but we have seen his works and the power of his word. Our faith will continue to be tested as we face the trials and tribulations of our lives. But it will also be renewed and revitalised through our communities and our service. Our belief in Jesus will carry us through all the shadows that we may face.\n\nYet questioning can reinforce our faith. Without questions we would not have all the innovations that we have today. Questions bring about growth and development and this applies to our faith. We should not be afraid to ask questions. Thomas himself was not afraid to question, yet we now cast him as a sceptic or a pessimist. John 14:6 describes Thomas asking Jesus how they will know the way because they don\u2019t know where Jesus is going. Jesus replies that he is the way, the truth and the life. Though he questions Jesus, Thomas was one of Jesus\u2019 most loyal and faithful disciples. John 11:16 describes Thomas as being willing to follow Jesus to the tomb of Lazarus, calling on his slightly unwilling fellow disciples, \u2018let us also go, that we may die with him.\u2019\n\nAs for doubting Thomas, he went on to spread the word of Jesus in Asia and the Indian subcontinents and founded churches as he travelled. He is one of the only apostles to have left the territory of the Roman Empire and met a martyr\u2019s death, killed by a spear near Madras, India. He is deemed to be the founding father of the church in Kerala, in Southern India, which thrives to this day. So Thomas is a great example for us all in our own lives, showing us that a little bit of self doubt and questions will not hold us back from reaching our own potential, as we develop and grow our own ministries in God\u2019s church, through our faith in Christ!\n\nMay we, O God, by grace believe\nAnd, in believing, still receive\nthe Christ who held His raw palms out\nand beckoned Thomas from his doubt.\n\n(Thomas Troeger, 1984, Psalter/Hymnal of the Christian Reformed Church)\n\nAlmighty and everliving God, who strengthened your apostle Thomas With sure and certain faith in your Son's resurrection: Grant us so perfectly and without doubt to believe in Jesus Christ, our Lord and our God, that our faith may never be found wanting in your sight; through him who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.\n\nAmen.",

    "summary": "From the sermon text provided, I've extracted the following top 4 concepts:\n\n1. The impact of technology on modern life and faith: The sermon begins by discussing how technology like mobile phones, the internet, and visual media have become integral parts of our lives, shaping our belief systems and the way we perceive the world.\n\n2. The story of Doubting Thomas: The sermon recounts the biblical story of Thomas, who doubted Jesus' resurrection until he could see and touch Jesus' wounds, highlighting themes of skepticism, the need for empirical evidence, and the journey from doubt to faith.\n\n3. The relationship between faith and questioning: The sermon suggests that questioning can strengthen faith, as it leads to growth and development. It portrays Thomas not just as a skeptic, but as a loyal disciple whose questions ultimately led to a deeper commitment to spreading Jesus' teachings.\n\n4. The legacy of Thomas's faith and ministry: Thomas's journey from doubt to spreading Christianity in Asia and the Indian subcontinent is used as an example of how faith can be tested but also can lead to significant achievements and the growth of communities of believers.\n\nFor a non-religious black and white pencil diagram that can be generated by DALL-E 3, I would select the first concept: **The impact of technology on modern life and faith**. This concept can be represented graphically without religious elements and can be understood in a broader context.\n\nHere's a detailed prompt for DALL-E 3 to create an image for this concept:\n\n\"Create a detailed black and white pencil drawing that juxtaposes the old and the new, symbolizing the impact of technology on modern life. On one side, illustrate a serene traditional landscape with a tree, a book, and a simple house. On the other side, depict a bustling modern cityscape with skyscrapers, a mobile phone, a laptop, and a web of network connections above.
