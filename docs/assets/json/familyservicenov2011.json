    "blurb": "Kevin's sermon on the 13th of November, 2011, delves into the nature of prayer, encouraging us to view God as a friend rather than a distant figure. He emphasizes the importance of communication in prayer, not just asking for things but also listening and understanding God's will. The sermon also touches on the significance of praying for others, including the new President and those affected by wars.",
    "raw_text": "## Family Service \u2013 13th November 2011\n\nThis morning reflecting on the whole subject of prayer. 'Prayer is something you do with your eyes shut!' What do we do when we pray? Who is it we are praying to? God \u2013 what is your idea of God? Jesus taught us to call God 'Father' \u2013 the word Jesus would have used is the word 'Abba' \u2013 Daddy. What sort of things do you ask your Dad, or your Mum for that matter, to do?\n\nSt John\u2019s Gospel tells us something else Jesus said when he was at supper with his disciples on the night before he died \u2013 'I am not calling you servants anymore, I am calling you friends.' If the disciples are to be the friends of Jesus, then Jesus is also the friend of the disciples.\n\nA friend is someone who really knows us. We\u2019ve thought about what we ask our Mum or Dad, what do we talk to our friends about. We talk about the things that excite us, that worry us. Sometimes, if we fall in love with our friends, we will tell them how much they mean to us \u2013 how much their friendship means to us. With a friend, we don\u2019t talk all the time \u2013 we will listen to them, we will think about what pleases them. That sort of friendship begins to change us as what our friend wants becomes as important to us as what we want.\n\nSo when we pray \u2013 we are going to ask God to do things, to look after the sick, to watch over people who are sad \u2013 this morning we are thinking of our new President, we are also thinking of people who have suffered in wars, those who look after the injured. But prayer is also about listening, trying to understand what God wants of us and then seeking to live our lives in his service and the service of others.",
