    "raw_text": "# Funeral of Ethel Morrison \u2013 Prayers\n\n## Introduction\n\n*I am persuaded that neither death, nor life,\nnor angels, nor principalities,\nnor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,\nnor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation,\nwill be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.\nRomans 8: 38,39*\n\nWe have come here today to remember before God our dear Sister Ethel to give\nthanks for her life, to leave her in the keeping of God his creator, redeemer and\njudge, to commit her body to be buried, and to comfort one another in our grief,\nin the hope that is ours through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n\nTherefore we pray that here today we may know the peace of Christ in\ncommunion with all God\u2019s faithful servants.\n\nGod of all consolation,\nwhose Son Jesus Christ was moved to tears\nat the grave of Lazarus his friend:\nLook with compassion on us your children in our loss;\ngive to our troubled hearts the light of hope,\nand strengthen in us the gift of faith,\nin Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\n## EULOGY Anne\n\n## READING - 1 or 2\n\n2 Corinthians 4:16-5:10\n\nLiving by Faith\n\nSo we do not lose heart. Even though our outer nature is wasting away, our inner nature is being renewed\nday by day. For this slight momentary affliction is preparing us for an eternal weight of glory beyond all\nmeasure, because we look not at what can be seen but at what cannot be seen; for what can be seen is\ntemporary, but what cannot be seen is eternal.\n\nChapter 5\n\nFor we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not\nmade with hands, eternal in the heavens. For in this tent we groan, longing to be clothed with our\nheavenly dwelling\u2014 if indeed, when we have taken it off we will not be found naked. For while we are\nstill in this tent, we groan under our burden, because we wish not to be unclothed but to be further\nclothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. He who has prepared us for this very thing is\nGod, who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee.\n\nSo we are always confident; even though we know that while we are at home in the body we are away\nfrom the Lord\u2014 for we walk by faith, not by sight. Yes, we do have confidence, and we would rather be\naway from the body and at home with the Lord. So whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim\nto please him. For all of us must appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each may receive\nrecompense for what has been done in the body, whether good or evil.\n\n## REFLECTION KB\n\n## PRAYERS\n\nGod our Father, you are a refuge and strength for us,\na helper close at hand in time of distress.\nWe ask you to help us now so to hear the words of our faith\nthat our fears are dispelled,\nour loneliness is eased\nand our hope reawakened.\n\nMay the Holy Spirit life us above our natural sorrow\nto the peace and light of your constant love,\nin the calm eternity where you live for ever.\n\nHeavenly Father,\nwe thank you for Ethel\nfor the example of life and faith she has left us,\nand for the fellowship we have enjoyed with her.\nWe rejoice in your promise of eternal life\nthrough Jesus Christ our Lord,\nin whom the bond of love is never broken.\n\nWe pray for all who mourn, remembering Ethel\u2019s sisters and brother, their children and\ntheir grandchildren.\n\nGod of all consolation,\nwhose Son Jesus Christ was moved to tears\nat the grave of Lazarus his friend:\nLook with compassion on us your children in our loss;\ngive to our troubled hearts the light of hope,\nand strengthen in us the gift of faith,\nin Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\nRemembering Ethel\u2019s life as a carer, both as a nurse and in caring for family members:\n\nLord we pray for all who are called to care, in our hospitals, in the community and in our\nnursing homes as they seek to continue Christ\u2019s healing work.\nGive them skill, understanding, sympathy and patience that in and through their work God\nmy work to bringing healing, hope and peace,\nthrough Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen\n\nA prayer for ourselves along life\u2019s journey:\n\nWe give them back to thee, dear Lord, who gavest them to us;\nYet as thou dost not lose them in giving, so we have not lost them by their return.\nNot as the world giveth, givest thou, O Lover of Souls.\nWhat thou gavest, thou takest not away,\nFor what is thine is ours also if we are thine.\nAnd Life is eternal and Love is immortal, and death is only an horizon, and an horizon is nothing save the\nlimit of our sight.\n\nLift us up, strong Son of God, that we may see further;\nCleanse our eyes that we may see more clearly;\nDraw us closer to thyself so that we may know ourselves to be nearer to our loved ones who are with\nthee.\nAnd while thou dost prepare a place for us, prepare us also for that happy place, that where thou art we\nmay be also for evermore.\n\nLORD\u2019S PRAYER\n\n## DISMISSAL\n\nGod our creator and redeemer,\nby your power Christ conquered death and entered into glory.\nConfident of his victory\nand claiming his promises,\nwe now leave your servant Ethel in your gracious keeping;\nin the name of Jesus our Lord,\nwho died and is alive\nand reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,\none God, now and for ever. Amen.\n\nBLESSING\n\n## COMMITAL At the Crematorium\n\nPraise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.\nIn his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope\nthrough the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. 1 Peter 1: 3\n\nThe Lord is full of compassion and mercy,\nslow to anger and of great kindness.\nAs a father cares for his children,\nso does the Lord care for those who fear him.\nFor he himself knows of what we are made;\nhe remembers that we are but dust.\n\nOur days are like the grass;\nwe flourish like a flower of the field.\nWhen the wind goes over it, it is gone,\nand its place shall know it no more.\n\nBut the merciful goodness of the Lord endures for ever\non those who fear him,\nand his righteousness on children\u2019s children.\n\nWhen the body has been lowered into the grave, or at a cremation, the minister\nsays\n\nAlmighty God, our heavenly Father,\nyou have given us a sure and certain hope\nof the resurrection to eternal life.\nIn your keeping are all those who have departed in Christ.\nWe here commit the body of our sister Ethel to be cremated\nearth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust;\nin the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,\nwho died, and was buried, and rose again for us,\nand who shall change our mortal body\nthat it may be like his glorious body,\naccording to the mighty working\nby which he is able to subdue all things to himself.\n\nThanks be to God who gives us the victory\nthrough Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\nThe Lamb who is at the throne will be their shepherd, and will lead them to springs of\nliving water, and God will wipe away all tears from their eyes. Revelation 7: 17\n\nBring us, o Lord God, at our last awakening into the house and gate of Heaven, to enter\ninto that gate and dwell in that house, where there shall be no darkness nor dazzling, but\none equal light; no noise nor silence, but one equal music; no fears or hopes, but one equal\npossession; no ends or beginnings, but one equal eternity, in the habitations of thy glory\nand dominion, world without end.\n\n## The Dismissal\n\nGod be in my head, and in my understanding.\nGod be in mine eyes, and in my looking.\nGod be in my mouth, and in my speaking.\nGod be in my heart, and in my thinking.\nGod be at mine end, and at my departing. Amen. BLESSING",
