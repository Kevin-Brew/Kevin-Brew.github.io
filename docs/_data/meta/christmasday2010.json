    "blurb": "This sermon reflects on the importance of recognizing God's presence not just in worship, but also in the ordinary aspects of life. It emphasizes the values of care and compassion, and the idea of God present in the world today. The sermon also encourages us to think beyond the immediate, and to consider our role in making God present in the world.",
    "raw_text": "Ten days ago, as I do every year at this time, I travelled into the Focus Ireland caf\u00e9 on Eustace Street, on the edge of Temple Bar to hand over the gifts you gave to Focus Ireland. As I remarked at the 9:30 last Sunday, I always find this a very humbling experience. There is the gratitude of the staff for our modest offering. Then there are the stories of those they meet in the caf\u00e9 and out on the streets. That place is a symbol of hope and care ever more necessary in our straightened times. For me it is also a very hopeful sign that fundamental values of care and compassion that marked Irish society were not entirely swamped by the Celtic Tiger. That place is also a sign of God\u2019s presence in our society. Those who work there may or may not have a specifically Christian commitment but they are definitely channels of God\u2019s love and care.\n\nWhen I came home, I picked up a book from my bookshelves that I had not read for some time. It is a book of some of the writings and sermons of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, from the early 1980\u2019s, \u2018Crying in the Wilderness\u2019. It is a book of sadness, anger, passion, hope as he reflects on the society within which he grew up, within which he worked as Bishop, making his prophetic call for peaceful change in South Africa. The foreword to the book is written by Archbishop Trevor Huddleston, who was himself a champion for the people of his Parish of Sophiatown, a township on the edge of Johannesburg and who was subsequently expelled from South Africa. In the foreword he identifies what lay at the heart of Desmond Tutu\u2019s philosophy:\n\n> (Desmond Tutu) expresses that essential truth about the Christian Faith: that it is based on an infinite respect for human dignity and human rights because of the fact that God himself has taken human nature and therefore endowed it with an infinite purpose and meaning which transcend the barriers of colour, race and creed. Trevor Huddleston in foreword to \u2018Crying in the Wilderness\u2019\n\nDesmond Tutu enlarges on this in a sermon preached in Johannesburg Cathedral:\n\n> The God whom we worship is wonderfully transcendent \u2013 St John in his Gospel sums it all up by saying \u2018God is Spirit\u2019. Yet when this God wanted to intervene decisively in the affairs of man, he did not come as a spiritual being. He did not come as an angel. No, he became a human being. He came in a really human and physical way \u2013 his mother became pregnant, and he was born a helpless baby, depending on mother and father for protection, for food, for love and teaching. When they looked for him in the houses of the kings and the high and mighty, he was born in a stable, as one of the lowly and despised. He worked as a village carpenter, knowing what it meant for his mother to loose a coin, to sweep out the house diligently by candle light until she found the lost coin and rejoiced at the finding.\n\nDesmond Tutu in \u2018Crying in the Wilderness\u2019\n\nOne of the names given to the infant to be born in Bethlehem that we read in Isaiah is \u2018Emmanuel\u2019, God with us. Matthew\u2019s Gospel begins with the designation of Jesus as Emmanuel. The closing words of the Gospel are a promise of continuing presence, \u2018I am with you always, to the end of the age.\u2019\n\nAt the heart of the Christian tradition is this idea of God present in the world of today. The writings of Desmond Tutu and others encourage me to think beyond the immediate. Earlier I spoke of Focus Ireland as a place of God\u2019s presence in the world of today, a very hopeful sign that the fundamental values of care and compassion that marked Irish society had not been swamped by the Celtic Tiger. All this emphasises for me the importance of recognising God\u2019s presence not just as we gather for worship, read and reflect on the scriptures but present also in the ordinary, in the ordinariness of family life, in the meetings in the shop, the sports club, the office; present also in the weak and the marginalised, in those uncomfortable encounters with the seller of \u2018The Big Issue\u2019, the cup held out for our loose change as we hurry down the street.\n\nThis Christmas, as the Celtic Tiger has very definitely padded off into the distance, and even in the harsh weather conditions that we have experienced of late, is a time to reaffirm who we are, as ones made in the image of God, as ones to whom God himself has come in the person of Jesus, as ones called to show Christ to the world in which we live. In our affluence we too often define others, allow others to define us, by what we have, the clothes we wear, the car we drive, the house we live in. In the words I quoted from Trevor Huddleston earlier, Christmas reminds us that:\n\n> God himself has taken human nature and therefore endowed it with an infinite purpose and meaning which transcend the barriers of colour, race and creed.\n\nThat is a statement not only about my status but also the status of the other, the one with whom I will meet in my home and beyond, with friend and with stranger, the insider and the outsider. I think of not just encountering God in the other but also to what extent do I allow the other to encounter God in me, to what extent am I willing, in my own life, to be a sign of God\u2019s living presence, to make God present in the world in which I live and move and have my being.\n\nThis whole spread of the Incarnation is brought out in the words of a hymn by Graham Kendrick, as he reflects on the self giving, self emptying love of God and our vocation, as ones beloved of God, to show that love in the world of today\n\n1 From heav\u2019n you came, helpless babe,\nentered our world, your glory veiled;\nnot to be served but to serve,\nand give your life that we might live.\n\nThis is our God, the Servant King,\nhe calls us now to follow him,\nto bring our lives as a daily offering\nof worship to the Servant King.\n\n4 So let us learn how to serve,\nand in our lives enthrone him;\neach other\u2019s needs to prefer,\nfor it is Christ we\u2019re serving.\n\nGraham Kendrick, Hymn 219 (Church of Ireland Hymn Book (5th edition)\n\nMay the Christ whose birth we celebrate be welcomed into the hearts and homes of our community and through us may his love be known in the world of today.",
