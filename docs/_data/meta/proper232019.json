    "raw_text": "This morning\u2019s Gospel reading is that well-known account in St Luke\u2019s Gospel of the healing of ten men who had leprosy, only one of whom, a Samaritan, a despised foreigner, returned to give thanks. There is a lot more to this passage than a lesson in good manners.\n\nSo let us just take this passage a bit more slowly than we might otherwise do. Even in the modern world, leprosy still evokes strong reactions in the communities in which it is still found. It is still, mistakenly, assumed to be highly infectious. Sufferers are often seen to be under some kind of curse. Because of this sufferers are often banished from their communities. It is a disease that is feared and in its early stages often goes untreated. People are left disfigured, sometimes blind, sometimes losing limbs from associated infections. The leper was one to be kept at a distance.\n\nOur story begins with ten lepers calling out to Jesus from a distance. For reasons we have already talked about that distance was more than just the number of meters that separated the group from Jesus. There was the even greater distance of exclusion, of alienation, of ignorance, of fear. These men are used to be ignored, used to being chased away, their cries for help being answered with insults, with sticks and stones.\n\nSo they stand at a distance and Jesus speaks across that distance; \u2018Go and show yourselves to the priests.\u2019 In Jewish Law, the only way a sufferer could be restored to the life of the community was for them to be certified as clean by a priest. They are being invited back into the community from which they have long been excluded. We are told that they are cleansed. Nine of them head off, whether they go to the priest or not we don\u2019t know and we hear no more about them.\n\nBut one of them comes back praising God, comes back and falls at Jesus\u2019 feet and thanks him. He thanks him. That is a translation of the Greek word used by Luke in his Gospel, \u03b5\u1f50\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd, a word from which we drive our word eucharist, one of the words we use for the service of Holy Communion \u2013 eucharist, thanksgiving. The root of that word, \u03b5\u1f50\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd, is the word \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2, which we would translate as gift, as grace. There is a grace at the heart of true thankfulness, of gratitude. For when the man returns to Jesus, praising God, expressing his thankfulness, Jesus says to him, \u2018Rise and go, your faith has made you well.\u2019 Again, to go back to the Greek that Luke wrote in \u03c3\u03ad\u03c3\u03c9\u03ba\u03ad\u03bd, the perfect tense of \u03c3\u1ff6\u03b6\u03c9, which we would translate as both heal and save \u2013 and the use of the prefect tense means an event in the past with lasting significance. That man, that Samaritan has been touched at a deeper level than the other nine. For whereas before he had, along with the others, called out to Jesus from a distance, now he draws near to Jesus. That gap, that distance of exclusion, of alienation, of ignorance, of fear had been closed.\n\nGratitude, a true and deep-rooted thankfulness, has the power to change us. We celebrate the Holy Communion, the Eucharist, this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving, as in bread and wine, we remember, profoundly and personally, the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. This is a remembrance, a thanksgiving that flows over into commitment, as we pray in that lovely post communion prayer:\n\nFather of all, we give you thanks and praise,\nthat when we were still far off\nyou met us in your Son and brought us home.\nDying and living, he declared your love,\ngave us grace, and opened the gate of glory.\nMay we who share Christ\u2019s body live his risen life;\nwe who drink his cup bring life to others;\nwe whom the Spirit lights give light to the world.\n\nThere is a model here of thankfulness for all of life. We thank God for the many blessings we enjoy \u2013 our homes, our families, those we love. Our thankfulness should flow over into a real and genuine concern for those who have no homes, for those who have lost loved ones, for those who are alone.\n\nMay we who share Christ\u2019s body live his risen life;\nwe who drink his cup bring life to others;\nwe whom the Spirit lights give light to the world.\n\nThis is Eucharist, this is Thanksgiving, this is Gratitude with Grace at its heart. Or in the words of another ancient prayer\n\nGrant O lord, that what we say with our lips,\nWe may believe in our hearts.\nAnd what we believe in our hearts we may practice in our lives.",

    "summary": "From the sermon provided, the top four concepts that emerge are:\n\n1. **Healing and Restoration**: The narrative of the ten lepers being healed by Jesus and restored to their community.\n2. **Gratitude and Thanksgiving**: The focus on the one leper who returned to express gratitude, and the broader implications of thankfulness in life.\n3. **Alienation and Reconciliation**: The theme of the lepers' alienation due to their disease and their subsequent reconciliation with the community after being healed.\n4. **Faith and Transformation**: The idea that faith has the power to transform, as illustrated by the Samaritan whose faith resulted in both physical healing and spiritual salvation.\n\nFor a non-religious black and white pencil diagram that can be represented graphically, the concept of **Gratitude and Thanksgiving** seems the most universally applicable and can be depicted without specific religious symbols.\n\nHere is a detailed prompt for DALL-E 3 to create an image for the concept of Gratitude and Thanksgiving:\n\n\"Create a black and white pencil drawing that depicts a serene landscape with a single tree at the center.
