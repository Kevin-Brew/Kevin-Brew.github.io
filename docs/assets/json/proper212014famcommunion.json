Brian O'Driscoll is not only very skilled but also determined, brave, and a great sportsman. Katie Taylor is a determined great sportswoman who provided a model for young women. Footballers like Packie Bonner, with his save in the 1990 World Cup, inspire us. Our heroes, we admire them; they inspire us; we want to be like them.\n\nOne of my heroes taught me that faith and science could be held together.
