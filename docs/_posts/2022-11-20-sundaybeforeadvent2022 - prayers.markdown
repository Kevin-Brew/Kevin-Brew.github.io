PRAYERS FOR LOUGHILE

20 TH November 2022

Through Jesus our King, let us pray.

As we celebrate Jesus, the head of the Church, the Body of Christ, We pray for the Church in all the world, we pray for this Diocese and for George our Bishop. We pray for this Parish and for our Rector. We offer ourselves, our various gifts and ministries. We pray that even our weaknesses can be used to your glory, for the good of all.

> Lord in your mercy
> Hear our prayer.

We pray for the nations of the world, for the leaders of the nations. We remember the people of Ukraine in their continuing suffering. As the COP 27 Conference draws to a close, we pray for all who will continue to work in the face of continued threats to our beautiful planet, for those who work for climate justice. We pray for Charles our King and for all those in authority under him. In these difficult times we pray for those who affected hardest by rising prices and shortages.

> Lord in your mercy
> Hear our prayer.

May we reach out to one another with greater love and better understanding. We pray for our homes, for our relatives, our neighbours and friends, particularly those who do not realise the extent of your love for them.

> Lord in your mercy
> Hear our prayer.

As we think of refugees, may those who have been scattered from their homes and loved ones be enabled to live again in peace and happiness. May the bitter and resentful find hope again and the confused find new direction.

> Lord in your mercy
> Hear our prayer.

We pray for all those who are sick at this time. In the stillness of this place let us remember those known to us, those who have sought our prayers, that they may know hope and healing in the presence of Christ. Let us pray also for those who care for them, at home, in our nursing homes and hospitals.

> Lord in your mercy
> Hear our prayer.

May the dying know your closeness and those who mourn their loved ones know for certain that your Kingdom stretches across both sides of death.

> Lord in your mercy
> Hear our prayer.

Our hearts are filled with thanksgiving as we realise again the extraordinary extent of your love for us. Merciful Father.
