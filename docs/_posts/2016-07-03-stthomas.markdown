blurb: "Kevin reflects on the journey of faith using the example of St. Thomas, emphasizing that faith is a work in progress, not a finished product. He highlights the importance of patience and inclusion within the church community, especially as a young child is welcomed into the fellowship through baptism. The sermon encourages understanding and personal growth in faith, drawing parallels between the disciples' experiences and our own spiritual journey."

St Thomas' Day – Trinity 6 – year C – 2016

Beginning with our student days and continuing on into the present we have placed a number of posters, cards and cuttings around our house, in the loo, the corridors etc that make us stop and think or smile and very often both. There is one that started life in our student days that was finally left behind, rather bedraggled, in Ahoghill. It was a cartoon picture of a caterpillar working its way through a cabbage leaf, with the caption: 'Please be patient – God isn't finished with me yet.'

Today, this second Sunday after Trinity, is also St Thomas' Day. I must admit, alongside the figure of Peter, I have always had a particular affection for Thomas. It was Thomas who, in John's account of the teaching in the Upper Room at the last Supper, when Jesus had said, 'You know the way to the place where I am going.' had had the honesty to say 'Lord, we don't know where you are going – so how can we know the way?' Then in our Gospel reading today, as the disciples enthused over their experience of the risen Lord while Thomas had been away, basically had said 'Lads, I would love to be able to share your belief – but I can't'. His was not an easy faith – it was a faith shaped in the midst of uncertainty and at times a deep agony. Early Church tradition would indicate that after the resurrection and the scattering of the Apostles he had travelled on to Parthia and then onto to India, where the Bar Thoma Church, which predates the arrival of western missionaries in India, would claim to have been founded by Thomas.

> That's plain enough, isn't it? You're no longer wandering exiles. This kingdom of faith is now your home country. You're no longer strangers or outsiders. You belong here, with as much right to the name Christian as anyone. Eph 2:19ff

The Church on earth is a living, growing organism – as the poster reminds me 'Be patient – God hasn't finished with me yet.'

We need to be patient with each other as we each grapple with the faith. In this the disciples provide a great example as they stand by Thomas in his doubting, in his questioning. Thomas was not excluded from the group as a disruptive influence. He was with them in the Upper Room the following week, when he had his own experience of the risen Christ. Easter came a week later for Thomas, but the important thing is that it did come. On that day Thomas expressed his own faith and not a second hand faith. The collective and individual faith of the disciples was a work in progress – God hadn't finished with them yet.

Today, as we are welcoming a young child into the fellowship of the Church and we will shortly be moving to the Promises which lie at the heart of the Service of Baptism. As I often say on these occasions these are not questions of people who have arrived, who have got it all sorted, they are questions of people on a journey, people with whom God hasn't finished yet.

We therefore receive and welcome you as a member with us of the body of Christ, as a child of the one heavenly Father, and as an inheritor of the kingdom of God.

We will pray that he will grow in the faith in which he has been baptised, that he will come to confess it when he comes to be confirmed, that he will bear witness to it by a life of service to others.

May we as a Church be a place of welcome and inclusion. May we be patient and understanding of one another in our search for faith and meaning in life. May each one of us, in our own time and manner come to our own understanding of the love of God in Christ and find that peace that he alone can give.
