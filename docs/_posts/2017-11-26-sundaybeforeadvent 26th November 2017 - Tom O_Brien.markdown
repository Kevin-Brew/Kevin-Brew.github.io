Family Service Talk for 26th November 2017

We live in a world that is weighed down by anxiety and stress. The country we live in is currently ranked 6th in the 0-25 year age bracket for suicide rates in Europe. We drink too much, misuse drugs, and have a high percentage of individuals on prescription anti-depressants... why? The answer suggests that human beings are not psychologically self-sufficient. We strive to fit in and long to be a part of a community.

Our Gospel reading today is situated at the end of Matthew's account of the life and death and resurrection of Jesus. Jesus directs the disciples to meet him at the top of the mountain, a significant place where God engages with His people throughout history.

Jesus makes an astonishing affirmation: "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me." He is the Lord of history and the universe. The disciples are now invited to invite humanity to learn from Jesus, baptizing them into the name of the triune God: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

Next week is the beginning of Advent, a time of hope and expectation. As Christians, we hope that Christ's light will shine in the darkness of the world in which we live.

The Great Commission is sandwiched between a great affirmation on the one hand and a great promise on the other: all authority is given... I will be with you always. Faith motivates us to proceed, supported by the trinity and the community of the church. As a church, we have much to offer in times of hopelessness. Jesus on the mountain confirms that it is God's desire for his disciples to share the good news concerning Christ. We are called to cross barriers and engage with people who are different from us, following Jesus' example.
