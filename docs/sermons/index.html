The following sermons have been processed as follows. Sermons in Dads collection were available in .doc and scanned .pdf formats.
<ol>
<li> The doc files were converted to PDF (so that the orginal content could be displayed on the site). Text was then extracted from the doc files. </li>
<li> The pdf files had optical character recognition applied to them. Google vision API provided the best results. </li>
<li> The files had a challenging format, no date was present, but hints to the date were there. Also (especially the OCR text files) had artifacts in them where the scan had failed. To remdedy this GPT was applied to
   <ul>
   <li> Clean the text, be correcting for well observed OCR issues (like l's being recognised as i's) </li>
   <li> Identify the date </li>
   <li> Create a short summary for the Sermon </li>
   </ul></li>
</ol>

<b>Warning:</b> GPT 4 is doing its best but it can make mistakes! In the top of each file you will find a link to the original unmodified PDF, this is the source of truth.
