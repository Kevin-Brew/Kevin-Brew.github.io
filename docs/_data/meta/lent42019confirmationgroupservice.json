He emphasizes the importance of acknowledging mistakes and making a fresh start, symbolized by the group exercise of writing down regrets and burning them. He invites the congregation to support these young people in their spiritual journey.",

Elke and I have been meeting up with them after school each Wednesday afternoon. This year there are nine: Matthew Bray, Aelfreda Young, Jayne Mangan, Ava Doyle, Amy Ennis-Crosbie, Elsie Bath, Justin O\u2019Neill, Louise Riis Byrne and Simon Fogarty. Elke and I have really enjoyed our time working with them. You are a credit to your parents, to the School \u2013 you are also a credit to yourselves.\n\nWe start off our sessions with pizza \u2013 they have come straight from School and we chat about what has been going on before getting down to work. Each week Elke has devised an activity that introduces the topic of the day. Over the weeks we\u2019ve been together we\u2019ve covered a lot of ground. I want to commend this group for the way that they have engaged with each topic we\u2019ve introduced them to.\n\nA few weeks ago, in to get them to think about the Church in the world outside, we welcomed Emma Lynch of Tearfund who talked to them about their work with refugees in Lebanon and in South Sudan. They decided they wanted to do something practical and they participated in the Tearfund National Coffee morning, organising \u2018Coffee to go \u2013 for those who had to go\u2019. How much did you raise? Then which of you were interviewed by Spirit Radio.\n\nThen last Wednesday we were getting ready for today. We gave them each a copy of the lesson for today, the Parable of the Prodigal Son and sent them off by themselves to think about and reflect and underline the bits that spoke to them. I\u2019ve got the sheets here \u2013 it was lovely to read over them and I will be sharing some of their insights later. They will lead us in prayer, using prayers that they have written themselves.\n\nSo we invite you to share with them in this act of worship as they move towards their confirmation.\n\n## SERMON\n\nThe group have just introduced us to the Lesson for today, the Parable of the Prodigal Son. It is not the lesson that would usually be read on Mothering Sunday \u2013 it is the lesson set for the 4th Sunday of Lent.\n\nIt is the story of a family \u2013 rebellious younger son, resentful older son, parent caught in the middle.\n\nSome of the things highlighted:\n\n- The impatience of the younger brother \u2013 he wanted his freedom now\n- His freedom and the way he used it did not bring happiness \u2013 began to hurt.\n- Brought him to his senses \u2013 he knew he had done wrong \u2013 he knew he had hurt his father.\n- As he headed home he was expecting nothing but overwhelmed by the love and welcome of the father.\n\nDraws together some of the things we\u2019ve been thinking about. We did a section on the commandments \u2013 I always ask \u2018Honour your father and your mother \u2013 how is that one going?\u2019\n\nI reminded you that your parents were once your age \u2013 they actually don\u2019t want to see you hurt, that they are a source of wisdom. I also suggested that when you get to 25 your views may not be so dissimilar \u2013 I would suspect that you are still not sure about that one.\n\nLike the younger son in the parable, we do make mistakes and we do get things wrong \u2013 how do we move on from that. We did an exercise I do with most groups to illustrate the completeness of God\u2019s forgiveness when we make mistakes, when we acknowledge those mistakes and make a fresh start.\n\nEach of you got a bit of paper \u2013 I asked you to write down one regret that no one else saw \u2013 just between you and God. And then we burned them and mixed all the ashes up until there was just dust.\n\nI would ask you the members of the Parish to remember this wonderful group of young people as they continue their journey to Confirmation and beyond. Each of you should have got a slip of paper with the name of one of them. Just remember him or her in your thoughts and prayers in these coming weeks.",
