    "blurb": "This sermon discusses the journey of faith, from doubt to belief, using the story of the disciples on the road to Emmaus as a metaphor. The sermon emphasizes the importance of being Christ for each other, listening and sharing in each other's pain, and the realization of Christ's presence in our lives.",
    "raw_text": "3rd Sunday of Easter \u2013 2011 \u2013year A\n\n\u201cWe had hoped ....\u201d Words to a stranger on the road; words spoken by someone for whom life had turned sour, whose dreams had been shattered, who was getting out of town. It is the start of what is for me one of the most telling of the resurrection experiences recounted in the Gospels. It is the account of a journey, a journey from doubt to faith, a journey of encounter with the Risen Christ.\n\nFor me it is not just a journey of these two individuals \u2013 it actually mirrors my journey (and I would suspect many other people\u2019s journey) through life \u2013 our own journey from doubt to faith, from despair, fear to hope.\n\nThere is another feature of this story as Luke tells it. The disciples on the road were not aware of who it was who was walking the road with them. As I thought about that I thought of how you and I can be Christ for each other along the journey of life. During the week, someone asked me \u2018What is the basic purpose for our being here?\u2019 This concept of \u201cbeing Christ for each other\u201d reminds me of the basic purpose and mission that must underlie all our endeavours as a Christian community and as individuals.\n\nSo what was it that marked out that journey along the road to Emmaus? There was first of all a basic honesty as these two followers of Jesus felt able to unburden all their cares. One of our deepest needs is that of being heard, of being listened to \u2013 to know that our hurt, our pain, our fears have been acknowledged by another human being. By the same token one of the greatest gifts we can give to another is to travel the road with them, listening, sharing, feeling something of their own pain.\n\nAs they went along the road, they started listening to the stranger \u2013 but only after he had listened to them. They had to know they had been heard before they could listen to him. But even here there is no dramatic break through, no sudden blinding recognition \u2013 but there is something about the stranger that holds their attention \u2013 only later, looking back do they recall their \u201chearts burning within us while he was talking to us on the road, while he was opening the scriptures to us.\u201d\n\nWe can not only be the listening ear of Christ, we can be the lips of Christ, speaking words of encouragement, of hope to people in their hurt and pain.\n\nAs they drew close to the village, the stranger made as if to go on. The followers of Jesus invite him to stay. There is something about this man who has listened to them, as they shared their hurt and pain, who spoke into that hurt and pain and they want more. \u201cStay with us \u2013 it is almost evening.\u201d Then that moment of recognition: \u201cSo he went in to stay with them. When he was at the table with them, he took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them. Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him; and he vanished from their sight.\u201d\n\nThat for me is a lovely picture of realisation, of pieces falling into place as the followers of Jesus realise he has been with them as they travelled the road. As I said on Easter Day, Easter is about far more than the empty tomb \u2013 it is about the Risen Christ present and active in the world of today, as he fulfils his promise to be with us to the very end of time.\n\nHe travels the road with us even when, in the darkness of our doubts, our worries, our fears he seems horribly absent. He is there; he is there sometimes in the stillness, sometimes in the presence of friend or stranger, listening to our hurt and pain Sometimes he is there for others through us \u2013 may we be faithful channels of his healing, strengthening peace in the life of another as we seek to be \u2018Christ for one another\u2019 along the road of life. The prophet Micah, as he confronted the faithlessness of his own generation asked; \u2018what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, love mercy and walk humbly with your God?\u2019 (Micah 6:8). May we go out from this place to walk humbly with our God along the journey of life.",
