Collect of the Day

Almighty God,
who called your Church to bear witness
that you were in Christ reconciling the world to yourself:
help us to proclaim the good news of your love,
that all who hear it may be drawn to you;
through him who was lifted up on the cross,
and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, now and for ever.

When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up the mountain; and after he sat down, his disciples came to him. Then he began to speak, and taught them, saying:

>“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
>Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
>Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
>Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
>Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy.
>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.
>Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
>Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
>Blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.

O God, make the door of this house
Wide enough to receive all who
need human love and fellowship;
Narrow enough to shut put all envy, pride and strife.
Make its threshold smooth enough
to be no stumbling block to children, nor to straying feet,
But rugged and strong enough to turn back the tempter’s power.
God make the door of this house the gateway to thy divine kingdom.
Amen.
