    "blurb": "In this sermon, Kevin draws parallels between the game of Jenga and the interconnectedness of the Church community. He discusses the importance of compassion, courage, and action, using the example of Aung San Suu Kyi and the Parable of the Good Samaritan. Kevin emphasizes that every person and their gifts are valuable to the Church, and that the community is stronger with everyone's presence.",
    "raw_text": "Over the last few years, a feature of our Fete has been the various games overseen by our Youth Clubs that are set up near the entrance. One of these is a large game of Jenga. The game begins with a tower constructed of simple smooth oblong blocks. One by one the players remove the blocks until the removal of one of them causes the tower to collapse.\n\nIt is a game of inter-connectedness \u2013 the lower blocks all supporting the ones above. It is also a game of instability and weakening as more and more of the blocks are withdrawn.\n\nI thought of this as I reflected on the passage we read from Paul\u2019s First Letter to the Corinthians. As I said last week, he is developing his thoughts on spiritual gifts in the context of the unity of the body. Every part has its place and no part is unimportant. As I was reflecting on this, I found myself also reading about one of the most influential voices for non violence in our generation, the Burmese activist Aung San Suu Kyi. The daughter of one of the leaders of the resistance to the Japanese occupation in the Second World War, she has taken a principled stand against the Burmese Military Regime, being held under house arrest for many years. Recently she lead the forces of democracy to victory in the latest elections in Burma. The writer of the book I am reading refers to her as a modern prophet of compassion.\n\nWhat are we talking about when we see that word compassion. Compassion has its roots not just in an external sympathy with another but rather an identification with another in their suffering. It is about the connection between the heart of my being and the heart of yours \u2013 and then following that connection. Compassion is about that interconnectedness that lies at the heart of the image of the body that Paul is using as he writes to the Church at Corinth.\n\nIn her own writings Aung San Suu Kyi talks of the way of compassion as the courage to see, the courage to feel and the courage to act.\n\nThe courage to see; this is to see beyond our own self interest, our own immediate concerns; to see the needs of the other, the one who is different. The great challenge to see our connection to those who seem to be different to us \u2013the individuals or groups whose life style we cannot understand, the traveller, the refugee, the addict, the prisoner \u2013 we share a common humanity, we are connected by that common humanity.\n\nSo there is the courage to see;. There is also the courage to feel \u2013 to really enter into the hurt, the pain of the other. In Luke\u2019s Gospel we read of Jesus coming across a funeral procession as a widow prepares to bury her only son. (Luke 7:13) Our English text says that Jesus \u2018had compassion for her\u2019. The Greek in which this passage was originally written is far more evocative. ejsplagcnivsqh \u2013 the root of that word refers to our bowels, our very innards \u2013our Lord was moved to the very core of his being.\n\nAs I recalled a few weeks back, towards the end of my time in Ahoghill, a young man took his own life \u2013 understandably his parents and sister were devastated. As few days later, his father told me of a neighbour he barely knew approaching him in the street, simply shaking him by the hand and saying, \u2018My heart is hurting for you.\u2019 There was a connectedness, there was the courage to feel another man\u2019s grief. This reminds me that we carry deep within us for one another the blessing of God.\n\nWe have looked at the way of compassion as the courage to see, the courage to feel \u2013 there is then the courage to act.\n\nAung San Suu Kyi has observed that \u2018Love is an action; not just a state of mind.\u2019 Or as we read in the First Letter of John:\n\n16 We know love by this, that he laid down his life for us--and we ought to lay down our lives for one another. 17 How does God's love abide in anyone who has the world's goods and sees a brother or sister in need and yet refuses help?\n\n18 Little children, let us love, not in word or speech, but in truth and action. 1 John 3:16-18\n\nOne of the best known of Jesus\u2019 parables is the Parable of the Good Samaritan. In the story all three, the priest, the Levite and the Samaritan see the wounded man by the side of the road. It is quite possible that all three feel a basic sympathy. But only one made a connection, only one followed through in open ended action, stooping down, bandaging his wounds, taking him to an inn. I go back to that description of compassion I gave earlier: It is about the connection between the heart of my being and the heart of yours \u2013 and then following that connection.\n\nI said that Paul was talking about gifts \u2013 and I have been talking about connectedness in the body, in the community. In truth we cannot talk about exercise of gifts apart from our connectedness in the community. As I remarked last Sunday, we are all endowed with carisma, with gifts to be shared, to be excercised in the Body that is the Church. Every gift, every person is valuable. We are stronger for your presence, we are weaker in your absence.\n\nTo go back to our Jenga tower. With several bricks taken out, it may still stand but it is weaker, it is more fragile. To go back to words of Aung San Suu Kyi. \u2018No single one of us is all important. But each one of us is essential\u2019.\n\nMay we as we gather in this place, in all our difference, in all our diversity, recognise in each one of us a particular gift of God to his Church and may we each offer ourselves, our souls and bodies to be a living sacrifice.\n\nSend us out in the power of your Spirit to live and work to your praise and glory. Amen.",
