    "blurb": "Kevin reflects on the Parable of the Great Banquet, emphasizing the themes of thankfulness and the pain of ingratitude. He draws parallels between the parable and our own experiences of being taken for granted. The sermon concludes with a call to respond to God's invitation to be part of His kingdom, to offer ourselves in love and service, and to live to His praise and glory.",

Then continuing on from our Service of Harvest Thanksgiving last week, we decided to continue with this theme of thankfulness.\n\n> Of course, the opposite of thankfulness is ingratitude. That is what is at the heart of our Gospel reading, the Parable of the Great Banquet and the simple video that followed it \u2013 the friends that would not come to the birthday party.\n\nAnother expression that we might use in this regard is that of being taken for granted. If we take someone or something for granted then, when all is said and done, we don\u2019t think them to be of value or importance. We can all recognise the hurt that would have been felt by the host of the banquet.\n\nI remember being at a birthday party as a child. We had all brought presents. At the end of the party as we were all going home, the birthday boy handed a present, a construction kit, back. He explained that he didn\u2019t actually collect these particular kits so he might as well have it back. I can still see the look of hurt on Anthony Palmer\u2019s face as he took it back.\n\n> Jesus was talking about a lot more than just a man putting on big dinner party for his ungrateful friends. He is talking about God\u2019s invitation to each one of us to be part of his kingdom. He has gone to great lengths to prepare a place for us. He has sent his son Jesus Christ to live among us, to teach, to suffer, die and rise again.\n\nThe invitation is there for us to follow. Sometimes we don\u2019t hear because there is so much else on our mind \u2013 we\u2019ll get around to it when we have got school, work, hobbies or whatever all sorted out. Or maybe life is difficult at the minute and it is hard sometimes to believe that God wants me, God cares for me.\n\nBut the call goes out, and goes out, and goes out yet again as God looks for people to enter into the life and work of his Kingdom. God loves us; he loves us not because we are extra good, extra talented. He loves us simply because he loves us \u2013 how do we show our love and thankfulness to him?\n\n> We offer you our souls and bodies to be a living sacrifice.\nSend us out in the power of your Spirit to live and work to your praise and glory. Amen.\n\nWe offer ourselves in love and service; to say the things, to do the things he wants us to do and say; to be the people he wants us to be in our care for people, in our sharing of the Gospel in all that we say and do; in our commitment to justice, in our care for this beautiful world he has given us to enjoy.\n\nThat his name be glorified and his kingdom come.",
