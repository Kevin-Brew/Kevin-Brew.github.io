He emphasizes the importance of acknowledging our faults and the transformative power of truth and vulnerability. The sermon encourages self-reflection and the pursuit of peace with God and others, as we strive to live a life worthy of our calling.",
    "raw_text": "PROPER 13 \u2013 2018 \u2013 Year B \u2013 Trinity 10\n\n'For I acknowledge my faults and my sin is ever before me.' Psalm 51:3\n\nWords from Psalm 51, the Psalm we have sung this morning. Tradition associates the composition of this Psalm as being written by David in the context of his adulterous relationship with Bathsheba, and his arrangement for the death in battle of her husband Uriah, and with it the prophet Nathan confronting David with the reality of what he has done.\n\nLast week, we thought of how David, enjoying the trappings and privileges of power, had lost his way, had lost sight of his moral compass, acting as if he was accountable to nobody, not even God. He had let himself down. We can think of people who may have let us down or people we have let down. But God takes us and uses us in our humanity, in our strengths and in our weaknesses, in our faithfulness and in our failures. Jesus is identified in the New Testament as being born of the house of David. Even in our failure God can work redemption.\n\nNathan came to David and confronted him with the truth of what he had done. We then sang the words of Psalm 51. As I read our Old Testament Lesson and our Psalm, my mind turned to a scene in the film 'Shawshank Redemption'. Andy Dufrense and Red, two prisoners, embody the journey of repentance. Red, in particular, shows the transformative power of acknowledging one's past and the possibility of a new beginning.\n\nDavid said to Nathan, 'I have sinned against the LORD.' Nathan replied, 'Now the LORD has put away your sin; you shall not die.' Repentance is about changing, not just saying sorry. It is an honesty, a vulnerability that leads to new beginnings.\n\nAs we go through the Psalm, we follow David's path to repentance. There is an acknowledgement that he has no claim on God's mercy. The words of Absolution in the old Service of Morning Prayer, from the Book of the prophet Ezekiel, remind us of God's desire for our turning from wickedness to live.\n\nThe starting point of that healing for David was truth. It is in that truth, that vulnerability before God, that David begins to regain peace with God.\n\nEvery service here on Sunday includes a prayer of confession and absolution. It can be a time of honesty with ourselves and with God, an occasion of healing and renewal. An exercise with Confirmation candidates involves writing down one thing they regret, then burning the slips of paper to illustrate the totality of God's forgiveness.\n\nGod's will for us is peace in his presence, peace with God through faith in Christ, peace with one another. We are called to lead a life worthy of our calling, with humility, gentleness, patience, and love, maintaining the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. (Ephesians 4:1-3)",

Tradition associates\nthe composition of this Psalm as being written by David in the context of his\nadulterous relationship with Bathsheba, and his arrangement for the death in battle\nof her husband Uriah, (an episode that we read of last week) and with it the prophet\nNathan confronting David with the reality of what he has done.\nLast week, as we thought of this dark period in the life of David, we thought of how\nDavid, enjoying the trappings and privileges of power, had lost his way, had lost\nsight of his moral compass, acting as if he was accountable to no-body, not even\nGod. He had let himself down. Maybe looking back, we can think of people who\nmay have let us down or people we have let down. Of course, we can trap people in\nunrealistic expectations that they can never meet. People are human and human\nbeings can inspire and human beings can fail and disappoint. But God takes us and\nuses us in our humanity, in our strengths and in our weaknesses, in our faithfulness\nand in our failures. This is underlined by the fact that Jesus is identified in the New\nTestament as being born of the house of David. Even in our failure God can work\nredemption.\nBut of course, last week we heard only part of the story. This week we have read of\nNathan coming to David and confronting him with the truth of what he had done.\nHaving heard that we went on to sing and sung the words of Psalm 51. As I read our\nOld Testament Lesson and our Psalm, my mind turned to a scene in the film\n\u2018Shawshank Redemption\u2019. It is a story of two prisoners serving long sentences in\nShawshank, a brutal high security prison in the Southern United States. There is\nAndy Dufrense, a white prisoner, whom we are lead to believe has been falsely\nconvicted. The second is a more seasoned black prisoner, we know simply as Red,\nwho befriended Andy. At periodic intervals Red is brought before the Parole Board\nwho are given the task of assessing whether Red is ready to return to the outside\nworld. Each time he argues for his release until this last time, forty years into his\nsentence, he is brought before the Board:\nPage 2 of 4\nPROPER 13 \u2013 2018 \u2013 Year B \u2013 Trinity 10\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcn6v7IaIfA\nAm I sorry for what I did? Not a day goes by when I don\u2019t regret what I did.\nI want to talk to that stupid young kid who committed that terrible crime \u2013 I\nwant to talk some sense to him \u2013 I can\u2019t, that kid is long gone \u2013 this old man\nis all that\u2019s left.\nThis moment of realisation is the start of a new beginning. Red, expecting nothing,\nfinds himself on the road to freedom. Our Old Testament Lesson concludes with\nDavid\u2019s confession and a pronouncement of hope:\n13David said to Nathan, \u2018I have sinned against the LORD.\u2019 Nathan said to\nDavid, \u2018Now the LORD has put away your sin; you shall not die.\u2019\nWhat we are talking about here is repentance. Repentance is more than just saying\nsorry, repentance is about changing. In David before Nathan, in Red before the\nParole Board, the barriers have come down. There is an honesty, a vulnerability,\nalmost a nakedness as they articulate a truth about themselves that they have hidden\nfrom the world, perhaps hidden from themselves. That point of vulnerability from\nwhich they have hidden, becomes a point of new beginning, new birth. Red finds\nhimself outside the prison walls, David hears assurances of forgiveness.\nAs we go through the Psalm we have sung this morning, we can follow the thread of\nDavid\u2019s path to repentance. There is a change in mood as we go through this Psalm.\n3 For I ac|knowledge my | faults \u2666\nand my | sin is | ever be|fore me.\n5\u2020 So that you are justified | in your | sentence \u2666\nand | righteous | in your | judgment.\nThere is an acknowledgement that he has no claim, as of right, on God\u2019s mercy.\nThere is a wonderful truth in the words of Absolution in the old Service of Morning\nPrayer, that pick up words from the Book of the prophet Ezekiel:\nPage 3 of 4\nPROPER 13 \u2013 2018 \u2013 Year B \u2013 Trinity 10\nAlmighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who desireth not the\ndeath of a sinner, but rather that he may turn from his wickedness, and\nlive;\nThe starting point of that healing for David was truth, as he goes on to reflect:\n7. Behold, you desire truth | deep with|in me \u2666\nand shall make me understand wisdom\n| in the | depths of my | heart.\nIt is in that truth, that vulnerability before God, that David begins to regain peace\nwith God.\n9 Make me hear of | joy and | gladness, \u2666\nthat the bones you have | broken | may re|joice.\n11 Make me a clean | heart, O | God, \u2666\nand re|new a right | spirit with|in me.\n13 Give me again the joy of | your sal|vation \u2666\nand sustain me | with your | gracious | spirit;\nEvery service here on Sunday includes within it a prayer of confession and\nabsolution. None of us come here with the same burdens that David had on his\nconscience and we can choose to rattle through it with little thought. But there are\noccasions when this can be a time of honesty with ourselves and with God and an\noccasion of healing and renewal. One exercise that I would often do with\nConfirmation candidates is to give them a slip of paper on which I ask them to write\ndown one thing they regret. They show this to no-one. After a period of reflection\nthey fold it up and then we burn them all, mixing up all the ashes so that nothing\nremains and I then say the prayer of absolution from the Prayer Book. I use this\nexercise to illustrate the totality of God\u2019s forgiveness when we are honest and open\nbefore him. That is often the thing remembered and remarked on \u2013 one group asked\nme to repeat it before their confirmation.\nAlmighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who desireth not the\ndeath of a sinner, but rather that he may turn from his wickedness, and\nlive;\nPage 4 of 4\nPROPER 13 \u2013 2018 \u2013 Year B \u2013 Trinity 10\nGod\u2019s will for each one of us is peace in his presence, peace with God thorough\nfaith in Christ, peace with one another. Then, freed from all that would hold us\nback, we can better live out our calling as articulated in the opening of our lesson\nfrom the letter to the Ephesians:\nto lead a life worthy of the calling to which you have been called,\n2with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one\nanother in love, 3making every effort to maintain the unity of the\nSpirit in the bond of peace. Ephesians 4:1-3"
