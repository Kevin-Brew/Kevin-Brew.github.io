    "blurb": "This sermon, delivered in 2010, explores the parables of the lost sheep and the lost coin, illustrating God's unrelenting search for those who are lost. It contrasts the exclusionary spirituality of the Pharisees with Jesus' inclusive approach, challenging the Church to reflect the latter. The sermon also encourages the Church to be a welcoming place for all, especially those on the margins of society.",

A number of years ago there were fears of its collapse when several of its 'names' were in danger of not being able to meet their liabilities. At the headquarters of Lloyds, there is a famous bell that sounds every time a ship insured with Lloyds has been lost at sea. There is a grim finality to that bell. The ship is lost. There is little, if any, hope of recovery.\n\nI mention this bell at Lloyds in the context of our Gospel reading this morning, with the parables of the lost sheep and the lost coin. As I read them, it occurred to me that the English word 'loss' has a wide range of meanings ranging from simply mislaying something to losing something beyond all hope of recovery.\n\nIn the eyes of these men, the people that Jesus was associating with were lost, they were beyond redemption. To put it bluntly they were scum whom no respectable person would associate with; certainly no-one who purported to be a religious teacher.

A\nnumber of years ago there were fears of its collapse when several of its \u2018names\u2019 were in\ndanger of not being able to meet their liabilities \u2013 this sent shivers through the whole of\nthe insurance world. A the headquarters of Lloyds there is a famous bell that sounds every\ntime a ship insured with Lloyds has been lost a sea. There is a grim finality to that bell.\nThe ship is lost. There is little, if any, hope of recovery.\nI mention this bell at Lloyds in the context of our Gospel reading this morning, with the\nparables of the lost sheep and the lost coin. As I read them it occurred to me that the\nEnglish word \u2018loss\u2019 has a wide range of meanings ranging from simply mislaying\nsomething to losing something beyond all hope of recovery. As I have often remarked, in\ntranslating from the Greek in which the new Testament is written, we often find that there\nare a wide range of words in Greek that can be translated by a single English word. The\nEnglish word lost is such a case in point. The word used in the Greek text of the portion\nfrom St Luke\u2019s Gospel that we translate as \u2018lost\u2019 carries with it connotations of destruction\n\u2013 in other words the loss is without reasonable hope of recovery.\nWith this in mind let us now look at the context within which Jesus told these parables:\n1All the tax-collectors and sinners were coming near to listen to Jesus.\n2And the Pharisees and the scribes were grumbling and saying, \u2018This\nfellow welcomes sinners and eats with them.\u2019 Luke 15:1\nIn the eyes of these men, the people that Jesus was associating with were lost, they were\nbeyond redemption. To put it bluntly they were scum whom no respectable person would\nassociate with; certainly no-one who purported to be a religious teacher. Jesus choice of\ncompany simply confirmed their worst suspicions.\nJesus replied with two parables of searching which illustrate God\u2019s concern for that which\nis lost. As often happens, Jesus chooses as his models of God\u2019s activity people who would\nbe looked down upon by his hearers, people drawn from the underclass of contemporary\nsociety. On another occasion he had used a Samaritan; here he uses a shepherd and a\nPage 2 of 3\nPROPER 19 \u2013 2010 \u2013 year C \u2013 Trinity 15\nwoman. Shepherds were seen very much as the bottom of the social heap by those such as\nthe Pharisees \u2013 their occupation inevitably involved breaches of the complex rules of\nreligious purity \u2013 not the sort of person you would want your daughter to marry. Women\nof course occupied a very subordinate position in society. Secondly there is the\nunrelenting nature of the search \u2013 the shepherd scours the countryside, the woman turns\nher house upside down until that which is lost is found. Finally there is the sheer,\nundiluted joy in which friends and neighbours are summoned to share in the successful\noutcome of the search. Such he declares is the joy in heaven over one sinner who repents.\nA stark contrast is drawn here between the cold piety of the Pharisees, who distance\nthemselves from those they deemed to be lost, the tax collector and the sinner; and the\nunrelenting search that God undertakes for those who are lost and drifting in the world. A\nsearch epitomised in the life and ministry of Jesus \u2013 a search that reached out to those\nwhom the Pharisees had given up as lost, the leper, those thought to be possessed by an\nevil spirit, the halt the blind, the tax collector and the sinner. Reaching out until those very\nhands that reached out to heal and welcome were nailed to a cross.\nThe Pharisees represented a spirituality that sought to exclude \u2013 the very word \u2018Pharisees\u2019\nmeans \u2018separated ones\u2019 \u2013 to distance itself from those who were deemed impure. Jesus on\nthe other hand was one who reached out to include, the draw in.\nJesus was challenging the Pharisees, who for their part were sincere men who sought\ndiligently to understand and follow God, to join in this unrelenting search of God for\nthose who are lost. This is the challenge that the Church in every time and place cannot\nafford to ignore. But that leaves me with an uncomfortable question in my own heart.\nWhat image do we present to those on the margins, those outside the Church? Can we not\nsometimes present an image more akin to the Pharisees than that of Christ? I am not\nsuggesting that people are physically barred from our doors \u2013 but they can feel\nuncomfortable, ill at ease. People who have met with misfortune, or have made mistakes\nPage 3 of 3\nPROPER 19 \u2013 2010 \u2013 year C \u2013 Trinity 15\nin their personal life, or people who just do not fit in \u2013 all can feel wary of Church,\nwondering how they will be received.\nBut this is the very place where they should feel welcome as they begin the process of\nputting their lives together.\nWe can be very good at guilt \u2013 maybe not so good at lifting guilt. I often think back on the\nwords of a colleague, now long retired, when he described the Church as a \u2018school for\nsinners\u2019. A gathering of people who know they are not perfect, who have no illusions\nabout their own perfection, who are able to welcome and draw in others that together they\nmay learn more of God\u2019s love and in their individual and corporate life show something of\nthat love to the world at large."

The image should feature a vast, intricate labyrinth viewed from above, with a single individual at the entrance holding a lantern. The lantern casts a soft glow that illuminates the path immediately ahead.

In the center of the labyrinth, there is a small, open clearing with a tree whose branches stretch out towards the paths leading to it, as if beckoning the searcher inward.

    "summary": "From the sermon text provided, the top 4 concepts that can be extracted are:\n\n1. The concept of loss and recovery, as illustrated by the bell at Lloyds of London and the parables of the lost sheep and the lost coin.\n2. The contrast between the self-righteousness of the Pharisees and the inclusive love and outreach of Jesus towards those deemed lost by society.\n3. The idea of an unrelenting search for the lost, representing God's concern for all individuals, no matter their status or condition.\n4. The Church as a community of healing and acceptance, a \"school for sinners,\" where people come together to learn and show God's love.\n\nThe concept that can be best graphically represented as a non-religious black and white pencil diagram without text is the idea of an unrelenting search for the lost. This concept can be depicted in a way that is universal and not explicitly religious.\n\nDetailed Prompt for DALL-E 3:\n\n\"Create a black and white pencil sketch that depicts the concept of an unrelenting search.
