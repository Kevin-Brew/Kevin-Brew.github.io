    "blurb": "In this sermon, Kevin explores the concept of discipleship, contrasting it with the modern idea of 'following' someone on social media. He emphasizes that Jesus is looking for true disciples, not just admirers, and that discipleship involves a deep commitment and a willingness to learn and grow. The sermon also highlights the idea of Jesus as a gift from God, not to be admired from a distance but to be received and followed.",
    "raw_text": "2nd Sunday of Epiphany \u2013 year B \u2013 2018 \u2013 Family Service\n\n'Disciples - Following in the footsteps of Jesus\u2019\n\nWell here we are at the beginning of 2018. Christmas is now well behind us. Back then we were listening to the story of the birth of Jesus. We are now starting to follow the story of Jesus the man. This morning we are starting to read about how he began to gather a group of people around him, his disciples.\n\nWhen Jesus said to someone, \u2018Follow me?\u2019 \u2013 what made them follow? But why? These men left their jobs, their homes, their families to follow Jesus. Following Jesus was a serious business \u2013 serious for them, serious for Jesus. What did it mean?\n\nComing to our own day, when we talk of following a lot of people will be thinking of Facebook. For the few who haven\u2019t heard of Facebook, people will establish their own page. And then people will start to contact you saying they would like to be friends, they would like to follow you on Facebook \u2013 read about what you think, what you like, what you had for breakfast. You could end up with lots of people following you.\n\nFollowing Jesus is not like following someone on Facebook. Jesus isn\u2019t looking for people who are vaguely curious about him.\n\nGoing back to the Facebook page. If we like the look of someone\u2019s page, or something on their page \u2013 it might be a photo or something they have written \u2013 you can not just say you are following them you can click on this icon and to say that you like what ever is on their page.\n\nAgain this does not really match up to what following Jesus means. He\u2019s not looking for someone who is curious about him, he\u2019s not even looking for someone who admires him.\n\nI want to use another illustration \u2013 can anyone tell me what this is? Hold up a fishing fly put up photo on screen This was given to me by an old man in Ahoghill \u2013 Tommy was a very good fisherman \u2013 he made his own fishing flies. I called in one day and he was making this one and he just gave it to me.\n\nIt is a gift I have often looked at; as I\u2019ve admired it, I have often thought of Tommy \u2013 but I have never used the gift he gave me.\n\nA bit later on in John\u2019s Gospel, Jesus meets Nicodemus, a man who was interested, who was curious \u2013 but did not want to commit himself. Jesus tells him \u2018God so loved the world that he gave his only son.\u2019\n\nSo I want to pick up on this idea of Jesus as God\u2019s gift to us \u2013 a gift not just to be kept on a shelf, brought down occasionally to be admired, but a gift to be used \u2013 a gift to be received, a gift to be followed.\n\nJesus is looking for disciples \u2013 not just people who will admire him from a distance. Jesus is looking for friends. At the end of his ministry, on the night before he died, Jesus said this to the men who had followed him, who had heard him teach, seen him heal:\n\nYou are my friends when you do the things I command you. I\u2019m no longer calling you servants because servants don\u2019t understand what their master is thinking and planning. No, I\u2019ve named you friends because I\u2019ve let you in on everything I\u2019ve heard from the Father.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t choose me, remember; I chose you, and put you in the world to bear fruit, fruit that won\u2019t spoil. John 15:14ff \u2018The Message\u2019\n\nPeople who want to listen to what he has to say, who want to learn, who want to walk in the footsteps of Jesus, who want to used by Jesus in the building of his Kingdom \u2013 he is looking for me and for you to be his disciples.",
