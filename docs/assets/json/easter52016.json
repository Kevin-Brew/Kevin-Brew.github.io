    "blurb": "In this sermon, Kevin explores the concept of 'love at full stretch', drawing from the Gospel reading where Jesus commands his disciples to love one another. He emphasizes that love is not just an experience, but a vocation, and that it has the power to transform both the beloved and the lover. He uses the story of Jean Valjean from 'Les Miserables' to illustrate the transformative power of love.",
    "raw_text": "I remember one time putting our older son to bed around the time he had just started school. He asked me 'Daddy do you love me this much?' \u2013 his hands would have been just a few inches apart. Then step by step his hands got further and further apart, with the same question, 'Daddy do you love me this much until the hands were at full stretch. I suppose he was rejoicing in the fact that there seemed to be no limit to our love for him.\n\nI often think of this idea of love at full stretch, when I reflect on the passage we read as our Gospel reading for today, with Jesus\u2019 command,\n\n> 'I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another.'\n\nHis disciples are to show something of that love at full stretch that Jesus is about to show for them.\n\nAs we proceed through this season of Easter our Gospel readings turn from accounts of the resurrection to accounts of his teaching in the Upper Room on the night before he died. In one sense these are looking back, but in a more profound sense Jesus is looking forward \u2013 looking forward to the life and mission the disciples are called to live in the light of his death and resurrection.\n\nThe writer of the 1st Letter of John sums this up beautifully in the words\n\n> 'We love because he first loved us. 1 John 4:19'\n\nLove is not just to be our experience \u2013 it is to be our vocation. It must lie at the heart of who we are as individuals and as a community.\n\n> 'By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.' John 13:35\n\nLove has a power to change \u2013 change people, change situations..\n\nThere is a very powerful illustration of this in the film of Victor Hugo\u2019s novel, 'Les Miserables'. Jean Valjean had been held as a prisoner for many years in appalling conditions. On his release as a convict he could not obtain work. He is allowed to stay in the house of a Bishop who provides hospitality. During the night Valjean, in his desperation, steals from his host.\n\n> 'Jean Valjean my brother, I have ransomed you from fear and hatred and now I give you back to God. There is a power of love given freely, unconditionally.'\n\nAs the film progressive we see that that act of almost irrational, generous love transformed Valjean from the man embittered by his unjust imprisonment in to the man he really was. I think of the words of the hymn 'My song is love unknown':\n\n> 'Love to the loveless shown, that they might lovely be'\n\nLove transforming the loveless into the lovely \u2013 into the loving.\n\nThere is a further truth that is embedded in that classic 'Les Miserables' by Victor Hugo:\n\n> 'And remember, the truth that once was spoken: To love another person is to see the face of God.'\n\nLove transforms not just the beloved but also the lover. When I love I see my beloved in a completely different light. When the Bishop looked upon the dishevelled prisoner brought before him by the officers, he saw not the man who had robbed and assaulted him the previous night but a man broken by life and in need of healing \u2013 in that irrational act of unmerited love they both encountered God.\n\n> 'I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another.'\n\nAs I have reflected on this passage this week, as I have watched that short video clip, I come to see in God\u2019s love not just my experience but also my vocation, my calling; that we might be ones in whom and through whom God\u2019s love, God\u2019s healing reconciling love is to be shed abroad in the world.\n\nThen the world will know that we are his disciples - not so much by the words we speak as the lives, transformed by our own encounter with Christ, that we live. St Francs of Assisi once said, 'Preach the Gospel at all times \u2013 and if necessary use words.'\n\n> 'Lord, make me an instrument of your peace.\nWhere there is hatred, let me sow love;\nwhere there is injury, pardon;\nwhere there is doubt, faith;\nwhere there is despair, hope;\nwhere there is darkness, light;\nand where there is sadness, joy.\nO Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console;\nto be understood as to understand;\nto be loved as to love.\nFor it is in giving that we receive;\nit is in pardoning that we are pardoned;\nand it is in dying that we are born to eternal life. Amen'\n\nPrayer of Saint Francis of Assisi\n\n'Preach the Gospel at all times \u2013 and if necessary use words.'",

    "prompt": "Create a black and white pencil drawing that depicts the transformative power of love through a sequence of four interconnected vignettes. In the first vignette, illustrate a withered, solitary tree in a barren landscape, symbolizing despair and isolation. In the second vignette, show a pair of hands gently planting a seed at the base of the tree, representing the act of love and care. The third vignette should reveal the first signs of life with small sprouts emerging around the tree, indicating the beginning of transformation. Finally, the fourth vignette should depict the once withered tree now fully blossomed with a flourishing garden around it, full of life and birds, symbolizing the complete transformation brought about by love. Ensure the transition between each vignette is seamless, conveying a continuous journey from desolation to rejuvenation, embodying the concept of love's transformative power without any religious elements or text.",
    "summary": "From the sermon provided, the top 4 concepts appear to be:\n\n1. **Limitless Love**: The anecdote of the father and son demonstrates the concept of love without bounds, a love that grows and extends indefinitely.\n\n2. **Love as a Vocation**: The idea that love is not only an experience but also a calling or duty for individuals and communities to embody and express.\n\n3. **Transformative Power of Love**: The story of Jean Valjean in \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" exemplifies how love can transform individuals from a state of bitterness and despair to one of grace and compassion.\n\n4. **Love as a Reflection of the Divine**: The notion that to love another person is to encounter the divine, as love has the capacity to reveal the sacredness in both the beloved and the lover.\n\nFor a non-religious black and white pencil diagram that can be created by DALL-E 3, the concept of **Transformative Power of Love** seems most suitable as it can be represented in a series of images that capture the essence of transformation without relying on religious symbolism.\n\nHere is a detailed prompt for DALL-E 3 to create an image for the concept of the Transformative Power of Love:\n\n\"Create a black and white pencil drawing that depicts the transformative power of love through a sequence of four interconnected vignettes.
