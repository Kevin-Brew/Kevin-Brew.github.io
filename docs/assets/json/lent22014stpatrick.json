    "blurb": "This sermon reflects on the spirituality of the Celtic Church and its rediscovery in the life of the Iona community. It draws upon the image of the beloved disciple, leaning on Jesus' breast at the last supper, listening to the heart beat of God. It also discusses the Synod of Whitby in 664, the meeting between the Celtic and Roman Christian missions, and the influence of St John and St Peter on these missions.",
    "raw_text": "It was the year 664. The Synod of Whitby, summoned by Oswy, King of Northumbria met in the Abbey of Whitby, the home of a mixed religious community under the leadership of Abbess Hilda. It was a meeting between two Christian missions, the Celtic and the Roman. The Celtic had come through Lindisfarne, Iona and the mission lead by Columba from these shores. In their spirituality they would have looked to St John. The other had come from the south, through Canterbury and Rome and would have looked to St Peter. The main issue settled in that Synod was the date on which Easter was to be observed and Oswy came down on the side of the mission from Canterbury. Eventually the Celtic Church adopted the Roman date for Easter.\n\nOn this Sunday closest to St Patrick\u2019s Day, I want to reflect on something of the spirituality of the Celtic Church and the ways in which it has been rediscovered in the life of the Iona community and the life and witness of George McLeod, who pioneered the rebuilding of the Abbey in 1938.\n\nI go back to that image of the beloved disciple, leaning on Jesus\u2019 breast at the last supper \u2013 listening to the heart beat of God. I would turn also to the opening chapter of John\u2019s Gospel that we read from at Christmas.\n\nAnd as we confess in the Nicene Creed:\n\nWe believe in one God,\nthe Father, the Almighty,\nmaker of heaven and earth,\nof all that is,\nseen and unseen.\n\nWe believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,\nthe only Son of God,\neternally begotten of the Father,\nGod from God, Light from Light,\ntrue God from true God,\nbegotten, not made,\nof one Being with the Father.\n\nThrough him all things were made.\n\nThe writers of the Creed, the Apostle John paint this wonderful image of Christ the incarnate Word at the very heart of creation, source of all that is.\n\nWe see it in some of the prayers of the Celtic Church in which God is invoked not as one separate, apart from creation:\n\nYou are the peace of all things calm\nYou are the place to hide from harm\nYou are the light that shines in dark\nYou are the heart's eternal spark\nYou are the door that's open wide\nYou are the guest who waits inside\nYou are the stranger at the door\nYou are the calling of the poor\n\nYou are my Lord and with me from ill\nYou are the light, the truth, the way\nYou are my Saviour this very day.\n\nWe see it in the art forms associated with the Celtic Church, the high crosses in which themes of scripture are interwoven with different aspects of the created order. We see it also in the wonderful illuminated manuscripts such as the Book of Kells, the Garland of Howth.\n\nIt is there in that hymn that is characteristic of the Irish Church, St Patrick\u2019s Breastplate (number 322 in our Hymn Book) In this hymn a number of themes are held together in one confession of faith. There are the great biblical themes of Christ\u2019s incarnation, his suffering, death and resurrection, the service of the saints through the ages. Then in verse 4 the writer rehearses the powers of nature all bearing witness to the wonder and glory of God.\n\nI bind unto myself today\nthe virtues of the star-lit heaven,\nthe glorious sun\u2019s life-giving ray,\nthe whiteness of the moon at even,\nthe flashing of the lightning free,\nthe whirling winds\u2019 tempestuous shocks,\nthe stable earth, the deep salt sea\naround the old eternal rocks.\n\nAll this crowned with that Christ centred invocation\n\nChrist be with me, Christ within me,\nChrist behind me, Christ before me,\nChrist beside me, Christ to win me,\nChrist to comfort and restore me,\nChrist beneath me, Christ above me,\nChrist in quiet, Christ in danger,\nChrist in hearts of all that love me,\nChrist in mouth of friend and stranger.\n\nIn recent years there has been a rediscovery of the riches of the Celtic tradition. In 1938 George McLeod, until then a Presbyterian minister in the Govan district of Glasgow, lead a group to Iona with a vision of rebuilding not only the structure of the old Abbey but also its spirituality, combined with his own passion for justice and peace in the world. Part of the outworking of this has been the hymn writing of John Bell, several of whose hymns are in our hymn book.\n\nI will close with a prayer by George McLeod, modelled on that Christ centred prayer from the Breastplate.",
