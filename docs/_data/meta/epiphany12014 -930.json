    "blurb": "This sermon explores the concept of Epiphany, moments when God breaks through and seems very real. It discusses how God makes himself known through creation, how humans are created in God's image and are called to reveal God in their daily lives, and the mystery of the incarnation. It also touches on the vocation that flows from baptism.",
    "raw_text": "1st Sunday of Epiphany \u2013 2014\n\nDon\u2019t we use some strange terms in Church? Some of those old names for the Sundays before Lent \u2013 Septuagesima, Sexagesima, Quinquagesima \u2013 they roll off the tongue; there was a history to their usage. The season of the Church\u2019s year that we have just entered \u2013 Epiphany. Starting on the 6th January it marks the end of Christmas, associated with the arrival of the Magi at the stable. Epiphany \u2013 again it rolls off the tongue; but what does it mean? So I looked it up in my dictionary \u2013 \u201ca moment of manifestation of divine reality\u201d Maybe a simpler way of putting it would be \u201cmoments when God breaks through\u201d, those moments of revelation, realisation, when God seems very real.\n\nYou see it in the psalms. Psalm 8 for example: \u201cWhen I see the heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have put in place, what is man that you are mindful of him, the son of man that you care for him?\u201d These moments when heaven and earth seem to meet. Our Gospel passage, which tells of the Baptism of Jesus by John in the Jordan; We read from Matthew. Mark puts it a bit differently, \u201cas Jesus was coming out of the water he saw \u2018the heavens torn apart\u2019 and the Spirit descending like a dove on him.\u201d A moment of clarity, of realisation.\n\nThis morning I just want to think a bit around this whole topic of epiphany, of God making himself known. There is that little verse you often see in gardens, \u2018you are nearer to God in the garden than anywhere else on earth.\u2019 Not being a great gardener, I have never fully identified with that one. But there is that sense that God is revealed, that we encounter God in his creation \u2013 whether it be the enormity of the heavens as we see them in the night sky \u2013 the stars we see millions and millions of miles away \u2013 the beauty of the rainbow, the changing colours of an evening sky as the sun dips below the horizon \u2013 or the amazing order of the atomic and subatomic world. The sheer order of creation, from the expanses of the galaxies to the interaction of the smallest subatomic particles, all expressed in mathematical models has never ceased to inspire me, to move me to wonder, to worship. Well may we say with the psalmist, when I consider the work of your fingers \u2013 what is man that you are mindful of him?\n\nThe Bible not only talks of God as creator; in the first of the Creation narratives in Genesis we read of God creating man in his own image, male and female he created them. What does it mean to say that you and I are created in the image of God? To be an image of something always means letting that something appear, involves revealing it.\n\nYou and I, in all our brokenness and frailty, bearers of God\u2019s image, called in our own daily life not just to bear an external witness to God, but to reveal God, to bring something of the divine to bear upon the world in which we find ourselves. To treat every other human being with a respect and a reverence; to recognise in every other human being, however different, however awkward or abrasive or difficult, something of the divine.\n\nThen of course, as we are reminded in the Christmas Gospel, there is the mystery of the incarnation. \u201cThe Word became flesh and lived for a while among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.\u201d (John 1:14)\n\nIn the Incarnation, in his divinity and his humanity Jesus reveals God, reveals what we are called to be in our humanity. And so St Paul tells the Christians in Philippi, \u2018Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus.\u2019 As ones made in the image of God, we are called to reflect in our own lives, as individuals and as a community, something of the self giving, self emptying love of Christ.\n\nIn our Family Service, as we think of the Baptism of Jesus by John, I am going to be thinking a bit about our own Baptism and the vocation that flows from our baptism. As we are reminded in the service itself, it is nothing less that to \u2018live as disciples of Christ\u2019, in our work and in our family life, in our relaxation. Called in fact, as ones made in the image of God, to be instruments of epiphany, that through us God\u2019s presence may be felt.",
