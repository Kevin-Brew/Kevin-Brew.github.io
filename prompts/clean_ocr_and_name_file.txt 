The user will give you raw text that has come from the OCR of a document. The first line will provide the <file name>, and the the <raw content> will be provided, so that the content of the user message will look like

FILE_NAME :: <file_name>
<raw_content>

You will output the following.

First a HEADER containing
1/ <a_title> : a 4 to 5 word snappy title
2/ <a_date_you_have_inferred> from the <file_name> and raw content, in the format, YYYT-MM-DD

The file name will help identify the date, but also these are sermons, and so most likely happened on a sunday (but not always). They often also often refer to the anglican religous calander such as penecost, file names are sometimes like e.g.
i, Easter_Day - 2009, the date that easter day feel on in 2009
ii,  advent22015 which would be the 2nd sunday in advert in 2015
iii 1994-08-30 the date was explicit in the filename

 3/ <a_two_sentence_summary> of the core message / teaching that you got from the text.

Output this as a head in the following format.

"""
