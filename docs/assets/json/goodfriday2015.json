    "blurb": "This sermon reflects on the significance of Good Friday, the day Jesus Christ was crucified. It explores the eternal significance of the Cross, the pain and loneliness Jesus experienced, and the ultimate triumph of his sacrifice. It emphasizes the personal relevance of the Cross, urging believers to see Jesus' sacrifice as not just a general act, but one that was done for each individual.",
    "raw_text": "On this night Christians of all traditions around the world are remembering the death of our Lord Jesus Christ on a Cross outside the city of Jerusalem nearly two thousand years ago.\n\nThis evening, in that extended reading from St John we have read of Jesus before Pilate. He is sent to the Cross as a result of the envy of the Temple establishment and the expediency of Pilate. In the shambles that passed for a trial we have heard allegations of blasphemy, of sedition. His enemies get their way and Jesus is condemned to death. Tonight we have read of his death upon the Cross.\n\nThat Cross has come to be seen as an event of eternal significance. Caiaphas may have thought he was just disposing of a trouble maker; Pilate may have seen this as just one more troublesome incident in this troublesome province on the edge of the Roman Empire.\n\nIn the light of the resurrection of Jesus, the Cross is seen to be of eternal significance, transcending barriers of time, an instrument of redemption. Seen in the light of the resurrection, in the context of the Old Testament, the events of that first Good Friday came to be seen as the climax of God's redeeming work, that in the person of Jesus on the Cross God suffers with and for suffering and sinful humanity.\n\nJesus, the same Jesus who died upon the Cross and who was raised triumphant on the third day, is recognised as the Christ, the Son of God. At the heart of the proclamation of the Gospel is the Cross of Christ,\n\n\"a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to the Gentiles; but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.\"\n\n(I Cor 1:23-24).\n\nThere is something in the Cross that I have always found compelling. The Cross, Jesus dying on the Cross, both eludes my understanding and yet meets my deepest needs. It is both an expression of God's amazing love but also God's judgement.\n\nI find the way that I begin to enter into my own understanding is by holding together a number of contrasts.\n\nThe love and the judgement.\n\nThe weakness and the power.\n\nThe sacrifice and the power of the Cross.\n\nI begin by looking at Jesus - not just a teacher, not just a good man. As we read in St John's account of the Last Supper; \"Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father.\" To look upon Jesus is to look upon the face of God.\n\nWe confess in the Nicene Creed:\n\nWe believe in one Lord Jesus Christ ......................\n\neternally begotten of the Father ............................\n\none in being with the Father .......\n\nThe relationship of the Father and the Son one of perfect communion. It is in the light of this relationship of perfect communion that I want to reflect on the sacrifice and the triumph of the Cross; on that cry of dereliction, that cry of utter loneliness, \"My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?\": on that cry of total victory, \"It is finished!\" The job is done, the victory won.\n\nThe words, \"My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?\" have always spoken very powerfully to me, it underlines for me a pain that goes to the very heart of the God head as the intimate relationship between Father and Son is stretched to breaking point. Jesus who felt so at one with the Father, dies totally alone, God forsaken: \u2018My God! My God! Why have you abandoned me?\u2019 The pain of the Father. Too often our theories of atonement have cast the Father at Calvary as a remote figure, needing only to be appeased. But we must remember words of Jesus to Nicodemus, \u2018God so loved the world that he gave his Son\u2019 and the description of God we have in the 1st Letter of John, \u2018God is love\u2019.\n\nThe Father gives up the Son. Not only does the Father drift out of sight of the Son, the Son drifts out of sight of the Father. There is, as I say, a pain that goes to the very heart of God.\n\nWould you at this point turn to hymn 224 in your books.\n\nHow deep the Father love for us,\n\nhow vast beyond all measure,\n\nthat he should give his only Son\n\nto make a wretch his treasure!\n\nHow great the pain of searing loss:\n\nthe Father turns his face away\n\nas wounds which mar the chosen one\n\nbring many sons to glory!\n\nThere is also the triumph of that Cross as Jesus cries out at the last, \"It is finished!\" The veil of the Temple torn in two, the barriers between man and God, man and man crumble. It is in the light of this that we read those wonderful words of Isaiah:\n\n\"Surely he took up our infirmities\n\nand carried our sorrows,\n\nyet we considered him stricken by God,\n\nsmitten by him, and afflicted.\n\nBut he was pierced for our transgressions,\n\nhe was crushed for our iniquities;\n\nthe punishment that brought us peace was upon him,\n\nand by his wounds we are healed. \" Isaiah 53:4-5\n\nThe triumph and the sacrifice - the sacrifice part of the triumph and the triumph part of the sacrifice.\n\nI spoke earlier of the cross as eluding my understanding yet meeting my deepest needs. That means at some stage I must engage with the Cross, I must receive the Cross. By that I mean that there must come a point when I see the Cross not just as an event that happened but one of personal relevance to me. That I see Jesus on the Cross not just dying for man in general but for me. That I see him not just bearing the burden of sin in general but my sin; that mine is the sin he bore, mine is the death he died.\n\nThere is something intensely personal in all this. Let us hear again the words from our lesson from Isaiah:\n\n4 Surely he has borne our infirmities\n\nand carried our diseases;\n\nyet we accounted him stricken,\n\nstruck down by God, and afflicted.\n\n5 But he was wounded for our transgressions,\n\ncrushed for our iniquities;\n\nupon him was the punishment that made us whole,\n\nand by his bruises we are healed. Isa 53:4-5\n\nThis is love and love is essentially personal, relational. There is a lover and a beloved. There is something in the Cross that speaks to something deep within me that prompts me, the beloved, to respond to the love of my lover. And so in the darkness of Calvary there is forged a new beginning, new life, new hope in faith. So we confess in the Eucharist, as we remember his death and resurrection:\n\ndying he destroyed our death\n\nrising he restored our life\n\nLord Jesus come in glory.\n\nAnd we dedicate ourselves to go out in the name of our beloved to think, to speak, to act as he would have us do among the people he has placed us with, in the situation he has placed us in, in the place and time that he has placed us in that God\u2019s love for this world may continue to be known in each generation.\n\nTurning once again to hymn 224, verse 3\n\nI will not boast in anything,\n\nno gifts, no power, no wisdom;\n\nbut I will boast in Jesus Christ,\n\nhis death and resurrection.\n\nWhy should I gain from his reward?\n\nI cannot give an answer;\n\nbut this I know with all my heart,\n\nhis wounds have paid my ransom.",
