    "blurb": "Kevin's sermon focuses on looking beyond external appearances to the true value within. He uses a tin of dog food filled with trifle to illustrate not judging by the outside, relating it to the story of David's selection by God and the parable of the seeds from Jesus' teachings. The core message is about growing God's Kingdom within us by being compassionate, understanding, and helpful to others.",

Seeds look pretty plain from the outside \u2013 but inside there is the whole beginnings of a plant.\n\nJesus used seed to give us a valuable lesson as he talked about God\u2019s Kingdom. If I plant this seed, something amazing will start to happen. God wants us to be seeds, ones in whom and through whom God\u2019s Kingdom starts to grow. That happens when we start to be the sort of people Jesus wants us to be \u2013 when instead of arguing, we start listening and understanding each other \u2013 when we see someone in difficulty or lonely, we help them.\n\nJesus told another story \u2013 story of the sheep and the goats \u2013 as much as you did it for the least of these brothers and sisters of mine \u2013 you did it to me.\n\nLet us just think how we can be do things for Jesus this week.",
