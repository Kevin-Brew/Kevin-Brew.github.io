    "raw_text": "# HOLY WEEK 2019 \u2013 Thursday\n\n'Do you know what I have done for you?' 'Do you know what I have done to you, for you?' John 13\n\nThat is a question that stands at the heart of our reflection on Holy Week, at the heart of our reflection on what it means to be a follower of Jesus. In the passage we read as our Gospel reading, the question is set in the context of Jesus\u2019 washing of the disciples\u2019 feet. Tonight this passage is set in the context of our service of Holy Communion, the Lord\u2019s Supper, the Eucharist. As we break the bread, as we drink the cup we remember what he did for us, 'Do you know what I have done to you, do you know what I have done for you.'\n\nAll the Gospel readings for Holy Week are drawn from St John\u2019s Gospel. This Gospel, written after the other three, is the most structured, most reflective of the four. It is as if he had time to think, to reflect, how he was going to present the Gospel of Christ, son of God, son of man, his teaching, his actions, his life, death and resurrection. He is very precise in his use of language. 'Do you know what I have done for you, to you?' The Greek in which John was writing has two ways of expressing an event in the past \u2013 one just refers to an event in the past, the other, the perfect tense, refers to an event that has past but has a lasting significance. It is this last form that John is using here. His washing of his disciples feet was not some casual, off the cuff, last minute thought of Jesus. This was a deliberate action that went far beyond the minor domestic chore of washing the feet of those sitting down for a meal.\n\nWe will see this very deliberate use of language as we follow the story on Good Friday in our reading from chapters 18 and 19. You recall, that when Pilate wrote the charge to be fixed on the cross, 'Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews', the leaders objected saying he should write 'He claimed to be King of the Jews'. Pilate retorts, 'What I have written, I have written.' This goes beyond my opinion, your opinion \u2013 this is who he is.\n\nAs his suffering draws to a close, we are told of Jesus crying with a loud voice 'It is finished!', it is accomplished. Again this is written in the perfect tense, this is a decisive event, not just for that particular time, not just for now, but for all time.\n\nTo go back to our Gospel reading:\n\nAfter he had washed their feet, had put on his robe, and had returned to the table, he said to them, \"Do you know what I have done to you? 13 You call me Teacher and Lord--and you are right, for that is what I am. 14 So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. 15 For I have set you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you. John 13:12-15\n\nDo you know what I have done for you?\n\nI have set you an example \u2026..\n\nFoot washing \u2013 that has been a tradition that has never really taken, isn\u2019t it? The Church readily adopted the command to break the bread and drink the cup. - but not this. What is it about it? Is it the awkwardness? That should not surprise us \u2013 Peter did not feel comfortable with it, with letting Jesus wash his feet.\n\n\"Lord, are you going to wash my feet?\" 7 Jesus answered, \"You do not know now what I am doing, but later you will understand.\" 8 Peter said to him, \"You will never wash my feet.\"\n\nIt just didn\u2019t feel right \u2013 he didn\u2019t feel comfortable with it, with Jesus at his feet, serving him. And then Jesus says this:\n\n\"Unless I wash you, you have no share with me.\"\n\nThen it occurred to me \u2013 there is an awkwardness to grace. Maybe we need to feel something of that awkwardness, the awkwardness of God meeting my needs before I can be of any use to him.\n\nIt is Jesus who washes their feet, it is Jesus who dies on the Cross. Michael Ramsey, Archbishop of Canterbury when I was growing up, who in his day worked tirelessly to bring the Church of England and the Methodist Church together, once wrote this:\n\nMy Christian faith begins not with anything I can do for Christ, but in what Christ has done for me.\n\nJesus dies for us \u2013 there is nothing we can do for him. And if he dies for me, he dies for others \u2013 for the one who is different, different creed, different race, different gender, different class; he dies for the person I don\u2019t particularly like, he dies for the person who doesn\u2019t like me. He washes all our feet, he dies for all our sins.\n\n\"Do you know what I have done to you? \u2026.. 15 For I have set you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you.\n\nI have set you an example, that you also should do as I have done for you. We are called not just to observe; we are not called just to admire, we are called to follow.\n\nBecause as John reminds us in the very precise and structured way he tells his story; these are not events in the dim and distant past that may interest us. These are events that stand at the very cornerstone of history, events of eternal significance. So we are not called to a vague curiosity, we are called to follow the Christ who kneels and who washes the feet, the feet of the one who is to betray him, the feet of the one who is to deny him, the feet of those who are going to run away \u2013 none are beyond his service, none are beyond his love.\n\nThe Paul writes to his beloved Philippians:\n\n5 Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus,\n6 who, though he was in the form of God,\ndid not regard equality with God\nas something to be exploited,\n7 but emptied himself,\ntaking the form of a slave,\nbeing born in human likeness.\nAnd being found in human form,\n8 he humbled himself\nand became obedient to the point of death--\neven death on a cross.\n\nHe emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, the one who performs the most menial of tasks, the one who gives himself, totally and utterly in the service of others. It is as we allow him to serve us, to meet our deepest needs of forgiveness, of inadequacy, of fear \u2013 it is as we go with the awkwardness of grace \u2013 that we meet him and are enabled to become like him - and he meets us in our desire to worship and serve him who is very source of my being.\n\nIn the words of the hymn by Graham Kendrick, \u2018From heav\u2019n you came:\u2019\n\n2 There in the garden of tears,\nmy heavy load he chose to bear;\nhis heart with sorrow was torn,\n\u2018Yet not my will but yours\u2019, he said\n3 Come see his hands and his feet,\nthe scars that speak of sacrifice,\nhands that flung stars into space\nto cruel nails surrendered.\n4 So let us learn how to serve,\nand in our lives enthrone him;\neach other\u2019s needs to prefer,\nfor it is Christ we\u2019re serving.\n\nThis is our God, the Servant King,\nhe calls us now to follow him,\nto bring our lives as a daily offering\nof worship to the Servant King.",
