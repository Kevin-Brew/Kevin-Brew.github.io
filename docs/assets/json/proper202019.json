    "blurb": "In these interesting times marked by division and uncertainty, this sermon calls for the practice of hospitality. Drawing from the teachings of Jesus and the nature of God as love, it encourages openness and generosity towards all, especially those who are different or marginalized. It also highlights a community project to welcome a Syrian refugee family, embodying the sermon's message of inclusive love and hospitality.",

The Brexit saga continues to run on and\nall the uncertainty that that brings. We are still coming to terms with the\nimpact social media has on our society, on the way we do politics, on the way\nwe receive our news. Over the last three or four years we have seen a rise in\npopulism, the influence of far right groups who have managed to use this new\nphenomenon far more effectively. We are hearing louder voices that speak of\nprejudice, a distrust of those who are different, those of a different culture,\ndifferent lifestyle.\n\nThis summer when we were in France we spent a week in Taize, taking part, as\nwe have done on many occasions, in their programme of worship, Bible Study\nand discussions. Each year is different, different people, different cultures,\ndifferent insights. There is a different theme for each year. Brother Alois, the\nPrior of the community produces a letter each year. This year it was entitled\n\u2018Let us not forget hospitality!\u2019 \u2013 partly in response to pressures in the world to\npromote division in society.\n\nWe begin with that simple statement of the nature of God that we find in the 1st\nLetter of John \u2013 \u2018God is love\u2019. Love is about relationships. There is a lover\nand a beloved \u2013 in that the lover is the beloved of the other and the beloved is\nthe lover of the other.\n\nI see this God coming to us and us coming to God in worship reflected in the\nwords of the Collect of today:\n\nAlmighty God,\nwhose only Son has opened for us\na new and living way into your presence:\ngive us pure hearts and steadfast wills\nto worship you in spirit and in truth;\n\nNow put this in terms of hospitality. God welcomes us when we approach him\nin worship. We may be awkward, we may be not sure of what we are doing,\nwhat to say, what to think \u2013 but God welcomes us, delights in our presence.\nAnd at the same time, we welcome God\u2019s presence among us in worship The\nlover and the beloved delighting in each other\u2019s presence.\n\nNow there would follow on from this, that if you and I are both loved by God,\nwelcomed by God \u2013 then there should be an openness to one another.\n\nGod is love. Love conferred on all \u2013 on saint and sinner, on faithful and\nunfaithful; a love not to be earned or deserved, a love freely offered. Those of\nus who have grasped something of that simple truth are called to share it.\n\nThe writer to the Hebrews, as he comes to the end of his letter, writes:\n\nLet mutual love continue. Do not neglect to show hospitality to\nstrangers, for by doing that some have entertained angels without\nknowing it. Remember those who are in prison, as though you were in\nprison with them; those who are being tortured, as though you\nyourselves were being tortured. Hebrews 13:2\n\nJesus, in his teaching, in his actions calls us to an openness that is generous and\ninclusive; one that goes beyond the boundaries of the familiar, that expects\nnothing in return. In Luke\u2019s Gospel, we read of Jesus saying to those who had\ninvited him to dinner:\n\n\u201cWhen you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends or\nyour brothers or your relatives or rich neighbours, in case they may\ninvite you in return, and you would be repaid. But when you give a\nbanquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind. And\nyou will be blessed, because they cannot repay you, for you will be\nrepaid at the resurrection of the righteous.\u201d Luke 14 12ff\n\nSomething done not because we are obliged to, not to advance an agenda. But\nsimply because it is right. We begin to incarnate, however imperfectly,\nsomething of the unconditional love of God who welcomes us in Christ, whom\nwe invite into our hearts in worship.\n\nThis is something that is done both individually and on a community basis.\n\nAnd I just want to close my thoughts with a project that has been gaining\nmomentum in recent months. Last year we welcomed Rory O\u2019Neill of the Irish\nRefugee Council to one of our Family Communion Services. He put out an\nidea that Howth, Sutton, Baldoyle as a community would be prepared to\nwelcome a family of Syrian Refugees being brought to Ireland as part of this\ncountry\u2019s commitment to play its part in responding to the humanitarian crisis\nunfolding in Syria. A group was subsequently formed, drawn from all the\nChurches and beyond. It is hoped, that before long, we will be in a position to\nwelcome such a family to live in our midst.\n\nI spoke earlier of voices that speak of division, that foster suspicion of the\ndifferent, those on the outside \u2013 this is an opportunity for us as a community to\nraise a voice for inclusion, for hospitality, for hope for those who have known\ngreat trauma.\n\nAs much as you did it to the least of these my brothers and sisters you did it to\nme.\n\nDo not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by doing that some have\nentertained angels without knowing it.",
