    "raw_text": "5th Sunday of Easter \u2013 Year A \u2013 2017\nFamily Service & Baptism \u2013 1st Sunday in the Hall\n\nWell we\u2019ve moved! Thanks to a lot of people turning up on Monday night to move lots of stuff out of the Church into the container. I was asked, \u2018Rector \u2013 do we need this?\u2019 \u2018Rector \u2013 can we manage without that?\u2019\n\nWe\u2019ve all been saying \u2013 \u2018Church will be different.\u2019 \u2013 yet Church won\u2019t be different. Because Church is first of all you and me \u2013 it is just that the Church (you and me) are going to be meeting in a different place \u2013 here in this Hall, the same Hall we have coffee in after our services, where the Montessori operates, where many of you come for scouts, for cubs, for Tae Kwando, for bridge, for Youth Club, for the Tuesday club, for Art classes, for Alzheimer\u2019s support \u2013 next Saturday it will be humming with activity for the Fete.\n\nAnd so it is lovely that today, our first Sunday for worshipping in the Hall in which so much \u2018ordinary stuff\u2019 happens that we are welcoming a new member of the Church.\n\nNew babies have never ceased to amaze me \u2013 the perfect miniature detail of those hands \u2013 the fingers, the finger nails \u2013 magic. Talking to Mums and Dads for a minute, when babies arrive as parents we realise, in a way we never did before they were born, they depend on us \u2013 in the early days of little sleep and lots of exhaustion it is food and drink and warmth and love \u2013 then of course there are lifts, football kits to be bought and washed, shoulders to cry on, someone to shout and scream at, to borrow money off, who is going to love and be proud of them through it all.\n\nA lot of what we offer can be summed up under two headings: Nutrition \u2013 the food we give, the love and understanding; Guidance \u2013 the advice, the education, the listening ear. Beatrice is already an irreplaceable part of her human family. This morning we welcome her into the wider family of the Church. Our lessons this morning have talked a bit about nutrition and guidance.\n\nIn our first lesson, Peter was talking to the early Christians about the importance of looking for \u2018pure spiritual milk that you may grow.\u2019 and elsewhere Jesus will talk of himself as \u2018the bread of life\u2019. In our second lesson Jesus talks of himself as being the \u2018way, the truth and the life\u2019.\n\nThis little girl is already physically very well looked after and loved as part of her own family \u2013 how do we look after her as part of the family of the Church?\n\nThis morning Beatrice\u2019s parents and godparents were asked a number of questions \u2013 I asked them \u2018will you walk with her in the way of Christ?\u2019 and then \u2018will you help her take her place within the life and worship of Christ\u2019s Church?\u2019\n\nA lot of it is going to fall on her Mum and Dad \u2013 but not all of it \u2013 we all have a part to play. When she comes here is she just going to hear about following Jesus \u2013 or is she going to see people around her to live that out in practice?\n\nLater on in the service we will all say to Beatrice:\n\nWe welcome you into the fellowship of faith;\nwe are children of the same heavenly Father;\nwe welcome you.\n\nIs she going to feel that welcome in the years to come as she takes her place in the life of the Church?\n\nSo today, in our temporary home, we welcome a new member into our family, the Church. May God bless her and her Mum and Dad and all who will have the care of her in the days and weeks and years to come.",
