    "blurb": "This sermon discusses the struggle between doubt and faith, using the story of Thomas and his doubts about Jesus' resurrection as a focal point. It emphasizes the importance of relationship in faith, the humility at the heart of faith, and the provisional nature of faith. The sermon concludes with the assurance of Jesus' presence and peace, even in our doubts and uncertainties.",
    "raw_text": "2nd Sunday of Easter \u2013 2023 \u2013 Year A \u2013 St Patrick\u2019s, Jordanstown \u2013 Doubt and Faith\n\n\u2018Rector, I\u2019m not sure what I believe anymore.\u2019 Many is the time that I have heard that comment in the privacy of someone\u2019s home. People will have come to that position for a number of reasons. It could be trauma or bereavement, or serious illness in themselves or in someone they love. Or perhaps news of some terrible natural disaster leaving many innocents suffering or dead. Or it may be just simply the speak has gone out of living, out of faith.\n\nThat remark, and many like it, come to mind as I read our Gospel reading for today with the story of the hapless Thomas, wanting to believe an yet afraid to believe. \u2018Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands \u2026. I will not believe.\u2019 And of course, he has been stuck with the title \u2018Doubting Thomas\u2019 ever since. I must admit a certain affinity to poor Thomas, an affinity I would suspect many of us share in our darker moments of faith as we make our own struggle between doubt and faith.\n\nThen as I think about this a little bit more, I realise that Thomas is not unique. If we go to Matthew\u2019s account of the Great Commission, as the risen Jesus sends the disciples out as he prepares to return to the Father, Matthew tells us that as the disciples gathered, \u2018When they saw him they worshipped him, but some doubted.\u2019 Matt 28:17.\n\nEarlier in Jesus\u2019 ministry, Mark tells us, after his account of the Transfiguration, of a man bringing his son to Jesus for healing. When Jesus asks for faith, the father cries out, \u2018Lord, I believe, help my unbelief.\u2019 (Mark 9.24). What these three accounts of Thomas, of the disciples on the mountain, of the father of the sick child have in common, as the central figures struggle between doubt and faith, is they all want it to be true \u2013 that Jesus has risen, that the boy will be healed. They are all presented as operating on the edge of normal human experience.\n\nWhen we are in those darker moments, when our world is collapsing arounds us, as faith seems to be swamped by anxieties about ourselves or our loved ones, of the sense of injustice of the innocent suffering \u2013 then spiritually and emotionally we find ourselves operating on the edge of normal human experience, wanting to believe in a God of justice, of love, of care, of compassion \u2013 yet at times not knowing what we believe anymore.\n\nSo what was it that spoke to Thomas, to the disciples who were on the mountain with the risen Lord, the father of the child, that spoke to their doubt and their pain, that brought them along the path of faith? Whatever else it was, it was not reasoned argument; not that there is no place for reasoned argument. There was another ingredient in the mix; that crucial ingredient was relationship \u2013 the support of the other disciples, the personal interaction through which, in which God is experienced as loving and caring. Thomas still had a place in the group. Matthew tells us that even those disciples on the mountain who had their doubts still worshipped, were still sent out by the risen Christ. I recall a lady in Ahoghill, who fought a long battle with cancer, telling me that even in those times when she could not pray herself, it was good to know that others were praying for her.\n\nI suppose what I am coming to here is a reminder that we don\u2019t have, we can\u2019t have the full picture. But there is more to it than that, we don\u2019t actually need the full picture. As Paul reminded the Corinthians:\n\n> For we know only in part, and we prophesy only in part; but when the complete comes, the partial will come to an end. \u2026\u2026\u2026. For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then we will see face to face. Now I know only in part; then I will know fully, even as I have been fully known. 1 Cor 13.9,10,12\n\nThere is something essentially provisional about faith. I often find myself reflecting on the words of Prof Vokes who taught me New Testament in College. As we attempted to tie him down on something, he would often smile and say: \u2018Gentlemen, we just don\u2019t know, do we? Sometimes the most honest thing I can say is \u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019\u2019 Prof Vokes taught us a fundamental lesson; there must be a humility at the heart of my faith. When I admit I don\u2019t know, I am open to new possibilities. When I think I have it all sorted, my mind is closed. That is the danger of fundamentalism, we lose sight of the fact that we can \u2018know only in part\u2019. When we think we see most clearly, that is often when we are most blind. When I am thinking about the provisional nature of my faith, my own uncertainties, my own doubts, even darkness at times, I often find myself reflecting on one of my most favourite passages of scripture from Paul\u2019s Letter to the Philippians:\n\n> Not that I have already obtained this or have already reached the goal; but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. Beloved, I do not consider that I have made it my own; but this one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the heavenly call of God in Christ Jesus. Phil 3:12-14\n\nI find myself coming back to the importance of relationship and that realisation \u2018Christ Jesus has made me his own\u2019; made me his own through his death and resurrection and the call that he has placed on my life. Within that relationship I am never alone. Within a relationship of love I can argue, I can complain, I can be angry \u2013 but I am not alone and I know, deep down, that I am loved and I love in return. The medieval mystic who wrote the \u2018Cloud of Unknowing\u2019 wrote of our relationship with God; \u2018By love he can be caught and held; by thinking never.\u2019\n\nThe Gospels tell us of the Risen Jesus coming to a group of men and women who did not know what they believed anymore, for all their hops and dreams seemed shattered. They each experienced something that they could only express in terms of experiencing Jesus risen and alive in their presence; Thomas in all his doubts and uncertainties; the disciples on the mountain top \u2013 each operating on the edge, as they struggled between doubt and faith.\n\nHe comes to us, in all our strengths and our weaknesses, in all our doubts and our certainties, honouring his promise to be with us to the very end of time. May we know his presence, and in his presence find his peace.",

    "summary": "Based on the sermon provided, here are the top 4 concepts:\n\n1. **Struggle Between Doubt and Faith**: The sermon discusses the internal conflict individuals face between doubt and faith, particularly during challenging times such as trauma, bereavement, or illness. This concept is exemplified by the story of Thomas and his initial disbelief in the resurrection of Jesus until he sees physical evidence.\n\n2. **Provisional Nature of Faith**: The idea that faith is provisional and not fully known is a significant concept in the sermon. It suggests that faith involves a degree of uncertainty and that there is humility in admitting what we do not know, as faith is only partially understood.\n\n3. **Importance of Relationship**: The sermon emphasizes the crucial role of relationships in overcoming doubt and fostering faith. It highlights the support of the community, personal interactions, and the feeling of being cared for as essential elements that help individuals on their faith journey.\n\n4. **Continual Pursuit of Faith**: The concept of persistently pursuing faith despite not having all the answers is highlighted through the reference to Philippians 3:12-14. It speaks to the ongoing effort to grow in faith, recognizing that it is a process and not a destination.\n\nFor a non-religious black and white pencil diagram that can be graphically represented, I would choose the concept of the **Struggle Between Doubt and Faith**. This concept can be depicted without religious symbols and can resonate with a wide audience.\n\n**Detailed Prompt for DALL-E 3**:\n\"Create a black and white pencil drawing that abstractly represents the internal struggle between doubt and faith. Visualize this concept as a landscape with two distinct sides. On the left, illustrate a tumultuous sea with dark, stormy clouds above, symbolizing doubt, uncertainty, and the challenges of life.
