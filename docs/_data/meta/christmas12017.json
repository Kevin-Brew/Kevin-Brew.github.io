    "raw_text": "First Sunday after Christmas \u2013 Year B \u2013 2018\n\nAnd I said to the man who stood at the gate of the year: \u201cGive me a light that I may tread safely into the unknown.\u201d\nAnd he replied:\n\u201cGo out into the darkness and put your hand into the Hand of God. That shall be to you better than light and safer than a known way.\u201d\nSo I went forth, and finding the Hand of God, trod gladly into the night. And He led me towards the hills and the breaking of day in the lone East.\n\n> Words spoken by King George 6th in his Christmas address to the Empire in 1939. They struck a chord with a nation facing into the uncertainty of war. These are words that have struck a chord with succeeding generations, particularly at this time of year.\n\nWe stand at the end of 2017 and the start of 2018. We look back on the past year and forward into the next. On the international stage we are still coming to terms with the Presidency of Donald Trump, of Brexit, of increasing tensions on the Korean Peninsula, the conflicts in Iraq and Syria, the Yemen. Nearer home we have seen the emergence of a new Taoiseach, continuing problems with homelessness, problems in the Gardai and continuing implications of the banking crisis that brought this country to its knees, leaving many homeless while those that triggered the whole debacle yet to be brought to account.\n\nWithin our own community, for some this has been a good year \u2013 a year of births, of marriages, new starts in school or college, in employment, in relationships, in new homes, maybe even retirement.\n\nFor the parish we have seen the work on the roof, the whole experience of worship in the Parish Centre, the joy of our return to our Parish Church.\n\nThis of course is not the whole story \u2013 there are families within our Parish who have experienced loss, for whom this Christmas was the first without a loved one. Others have experienced different crises in their lives, anxieties over loved ones facing ill health or other uncertainty in their lives. We will continue to support them with our love and our prayers.\n\nWe journey on into the New Year, wondering what lies ahead for us. As the shepherds journey on, back to the hillsides, back to resume their daily routine, the joys and sorrows of family life. Mary and Joseph prepare to move on, beginning with the first of the ceremonies following child-birth, the circumcision of their first born son. In Luke\u2019s Gospel, we hear at different points of Mary, hearing people talk about her child, \u2018pondering these words in her heart.\u2019 What lay ahead for her? What lay ahead for her child?\n\nThat is the story that, Sunday by Sunday, we will now take up.\n\nWe look back into 2017; we look forward into 2018. And it is here that the image of Mary & Joseph, the shepherds, moving on, journeying on chimes with those words I quoted at the outset\n\nAnd I said to the man who stood at the gate of the year: \u201cGive me a light that I may tread safely into the unknown.\u201d\nAnd he replied:\n\u201cGo out into the darkness and put your hand into the Hand of God. That shall be to you better than light and safer than a known way.\u201d\n\nSo I went forth, and finding the Hand of God, trod gladly into the night. And He led me towards the hills and the breaking of day in the lone East.\n\n> These words were written as a preamble to a poem by Minnie Louise Haskins. This poem, written shortly after she arrived in India to work as a Methodist Missionary, reflects on presence of God amidst all the uncertainties of life.\n\nSo heart be still:\nWhat need our little life\nOur human life to know,\nIf God hath comprehension?\nIn all the dizzy strife\nOf things both high and low,\nGod hideth His intention.\n\nGod knows. His will\nIs best. The stretch of years\nWhich wind ahead, so dim\nTo our imperfect vision,\nAre clear to God. Our fears\nAre premature; In Him,\nAll time hath full provision.\n\nThen rest: until\nGod moves to lift the veil\nFrom our impatient eyes,\nWhen, as the sweeter features\nOf Life\u2019s stern face we hail,\nFair beyond all surmise\nGod\u2019s thought around His creatures\nOur mind shall fill.\n\nWe go forward into 2018 with our hopes and fears and plans for the future. For some this will be a year of new beginnings. Children will be starting school, moving on to secondary school, college or employment; people will be getting married having children of their own. For some there are clouds on the horizon, uncertainty about themselves or loved ones. The God who has accompanied us on our journey to this point will not leave us or forsake us. We may lose sight of him but he does not lose sight of us.\n\nSo heart be still:\nWhat need our little life\nOur human life to know,\nIf God hath comprehension?\nIn all the dizzy strife\nOf things both high and low,\nGod hideth His intention.\n\nGod knows. His will\nIs best. The stretch of years\nWhich wind ahead, so dim\nTo our imperfect vision,\nAre clear to God. Our fears\nAre premature; In Him,\nAll time hath full provision.\n\nAnd as a Parish we will continue our journey into the future, as we seek to show something of Christ to this community and society in which we are set. I would invite us this coming year to reflect on the challenge laid down to us by the Archbishop on his recent visit to dedicate the work on the roof. Before coming, he asked of us two questions: \u2018What is your history and what is your vision?\u2019 Picking up on the title of the illustrated Gospel, the Garland of Howth, featured in our East Window, he urged us to offer a Garland of Welcome and Inclusion to those who come to live among us, to those who come to worship with us.\n\nAs we look forward into the future may we \u2018put your hand into the Hand of God. That shall be to us better than light and safer than a known way.\u2019",

    "prompt": "Create a black and white pencil drawing that captures the essence of transition and new beginnings. The image should feature a large, detailed tree in the center, with half of its branches in full bloom and the other half shedding leaves to symbolize change and renewal. At the base of the tree, a path should start, winding its way from the roots and splitting into two directions, one leading towards a rising sun on the horizon and the other heading towards a moonlit night, representing the unknown future and the choices that lie ahead. No human figures or religious symbols should be present, just the tree, path, sun, and moon in a balanced and harmonious composition.",
    "summary": "From the sermon provided, the top 4 concepts that emerge are:\n\n1. Trust in Divine Guidance: The recurring theme of placing one's hand into the \"Hand of God\" as a metaphor for divine guidance and support in the face of uncertainty and the unknown future.\n\n2. Transition and New Beginnings: The mention of the end of one year and the start of another, along with life events such as births, marriages, and new ventures, symbolizes the concept of transition and the start of new chapters in life.\n\n3. Community and Support: The reference to the parish community, both in terms of shared experiences like the renovation of the church roof and the support for those who have suffered loss or are facing challenges, highlights the importance of community and mutual support.\n\n4. Reflection and Vision: The call to reflect on the past (\"What is your history?\") and to develop a vision for the future (\"What is your vision?\"), as well as the encouragement to offer a \"Garland of Welcome and Inclusion,\" speaks to the concept of introspection and the formulation of a forward-looking perspective.\n\nFor a non-religious black and white pencil diagram that can be graphically represented, the concept of \"Transition and New Beginnings\" seems most suitable, as it can be depicted without religious symbolism and is universally relatable.\n\n**Detailed Prompt for DALL-E 3:**\n\nCreate a black and white pencil drawing that captures the essence of transition and new beginnings. The image should feature a large, detailed tree in the center, with half of its branches in full bloom and the other half shedding leaves to symbolize change and renewal. At the base of the tree, a path should start, winding its way from the roots and splitting into two directions, one leading towards a rising sun on the horizon and the other heading towards a moonlit night, representing the unknown future and the choices that lie ahead. No human figures or religious symbols should be present, just the tree, path, sun, and moon in a balanced and harmonious composition."
