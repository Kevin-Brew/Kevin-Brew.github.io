    "raw_text": "EASTER DAY 2019\n\n'Woman, why are you weeping?' Words of an angel, words of a gardener to a woman weeping at a graveside. We have just sung as our opening hymn on Easter Day that hymn of triumph: Jesus Christ is risen today, Alleluia! Our triumphant holy day, Alleluia! Who did once, upon the cross, Alleluia! Suffer to redeem our loss. Alleluia!\n\nThe Cross is a thing of the past; the work is done, 'It is finished', the task complete, the job is done. Of course for Mary coming to the tomb that first Easter morning, the cross was anything but a thing of the past. The memories of watching Jesus die were still raw. She came that day to mourn the death of a dear friend, to pay her respects; to be there, as folk often are when they go to a grave, with her memories; memories of acceptance, of inspiration, of friendship; memories of someone who had touched the hearts of those on the margins, who had sat down with the sinners, had touched the leper; who had spoken words of healing and liberation, 'Your sins are forgiven \u2013 now go and sin no more.'\n\nFinding the tomb open and empty is at that point not a source of joy or hope or celebration, it is an occasion of deep despair and desolation. She has rushed back to tell the disciples; 'The tomb is empty, someone has taken the body!' Peter and the other disciple rush past her, rush to the tomb. They see the body has gone but the grave clothes are still there. They then head back leaving Mary all by herself, with her confusion, her despair, her tears.\n\nEASTER DAY 2019\n\nJohn tells us she looked in the tomb. The body is gone, two angels sitting where he had been laid. 'Woman, why are you weeping?' 'The body is gone \u2013 I don\u2019t know where it is.' And she leaves. Again, this time a stranger asks, 'Woman, why are you weeping?' 'Look if you know where the body is \u2013 just tell me and I will take it somewhere else.' Then she hears her name, 'Mary'. And it all falls into place. Gone is the confusion, the hurt and the pain. Now there is joy and hope as she goes to embrace her Lord. Now she could sing 'Jesus Christ is risen today, Alleluia!'\n\nThere is something profound in the way John has chosen to tell his story. The change in Mary, the subsequent change in the other disciples comes not when they see an empty tomb, that only adds to the pain and confusion. The change comes when they experience the risen Jesus.\n\nThis led me to think a bit about how the risen Christ comes to us. As we read the Gospel accounts of the appearance of the risen Jesus to the disciples after the resurrection there is an element of the unexpected in all of them. He comes to Mary in the garden; he comes to the disciples as they hide behind locked doors, standing among them, showing his hands and his side, speaking words of peace; he comes to disciples, frightened and despairing as they hurry out of Jerusalem along the Emmaus Road, listens to their pain and their confusion, and at the end of day makes himself known in the breaking of bread. He comes also to Saul of Tarsus, storming along the road to Damascus, with plans to nip this risen Jesus business in the bud, challenges his hostility and calls him to service.\n\nEASTER DAY 2019\n\nThe risen Christ comes to us. Comes to us in our sorrow and speaks words of hope and life to our distracted hearts. He comes to us in our awareness of weakness and failure in his service and shows us his pierced hands and speaks his words of forgiveness. Comes to us in our confusion and speaks his words of peace. Christ comes to us in and through other people. As I say that, I am sure many of you can think of particular people who have touched your lives \u2013 it may have been a time of crisis in your life - or it may have been in a chance meeting or encounter. Whatever they said, or maybe it was just their presence \u2013 you just sensed Christ\u2019s presence with you. In truth, Christ makes himself present in and through the most unlikely of people.\n\nHe makes himself present in and through you and me. As followers of Jesus may we be open to see his presence in others and may we be open to being channels of his presence for other people.\n\n1 Christ be beside me,\nChrist be before me,\nChrist be behind me,\nKing of my heart.\nChrist be within me,\nChrist be below me,\nChrist be above me,\nnever to part.\n\n3 Christ be in all hearts thinking about me,\nChrist be on all tongues telling of me.\nChrist be the vision in eyes that see me, in ears that hear me, Christ ever be.",

    "prompt": "Create a black and white pencil drawing that depicts the transformation from grief to joy. The scene should start with a solitary figure hunched over in a posture of sorrow, with drooping shoulders and a bowed head, sitting on a bench in a barren landscape. The figure's hands are clasped together, and a wilted flower lies on the ground, symbolizing loss. As the image progresses to the right, the landscape gradually transforms into a flourishing garden with blooming flowers. The figure begins to stand, gradually lifting their head and straightening their posture, until they are fully upright and looking towards the sky with arms outstretched in a gesture of release and joy. Birds are taking flight from the nearby trees, symbolizing the lifting of spirits and newfound freedom. The transition from left to right should convey a powerful sense of moving from darkness into light, embodying the emotional journey from deep sorrow to overwhelming joy. No religious symbols or text should be included in the drawing.",
    "summary": "From the sermon text provided, here are the top 4 concepts:\n\n1. **Resurrection and Triumph**: The concept of Jesus Christ rising from the dead, symbolizing hope, joy, and the victory over death, as celebrated on Easter Day.\n\n2. **Grief to Joy**: The transformation of Mary Magdalene's sorrow into joy upon realizing that Jesus has risen, representing the shift from despair to hope.\n\n3. **Presence of the Risen Christ**: The idea that the risen Christ appears in unexpected ways and through various means, including through other people, symbolizing comfort, peace, and the divine presence in everyday life.\n\n4. **Christ's Omnipresence and Guidance**: The invocation of Christ's presence in all aspects of life, as expressed in the hymn, signifying protection, guidance, and the constant companionship of the divine.\n\nFor a non-religious black and white pencil diagram that can be graphically represented, the concept of \"Grief to Joy\" seems most suitable. It is a universal theme that can be depicted without religious symbols and can resonate with a broad audience.\n\nHere is a detailed prompt for DALL-E 3 to create an image for the concept of \"Grief to Joy\":\n\nPrompt: \"Create a black and white pencil drawing that depicts the transformation from grief to joy.
