One thing you have to\nsay for him is that you know what he thinks and he is not afraid to say it.\nThe trouble with someone like him is that he must be a nightmare for the PR\npeople in the Republican Party. There is a term often used by PR people in a\nsituation like this \u2013 they will refer to their candidate going \u2018off message\u2019 and\nthey will revert to \u2018damage control\u2019 as they explain to the media that the\ncandidate has been misinterpreted, or that he/she is being quoted out of context,\nthat what was being said was part of a much bigger and more rounded picture.\nBut the sentiment behind it all in the PR room is, \u2018Oh why did he/she have to\nsay that? How do we get this person back under control?\u2019\nThese thoughts came to my mind as I read out Gospel reading this morning. as\nwe read of Jesus speaking in very forthright terms such as:\n51Do you think that I have come to bring peace to the earth? No, I tell\nyou, but rather division! Luke 12:51\nand talk of families being divided.\nIt is one of those Gospel readings where I find myself thinking, \u2018Lord, I really\nwish you hadn\u2019t said that.\u2019 It hardly fits in with the \u2018gentle Jesus, meek and\nmild\u2019 that we sing about in the children\u2019s hymns.\nSo what are we to make of these uncomfortable words of Jesus that are in a\npassage set to be read at public worship?\nPage 2 of 3\nPROPER 15 \u2013 Year C \u2013 2016 \u2013 Trinity 15\nRather than tackle that question head on I just want to share a not unrelated\nmemory. As I reflected on our Gospel reading my mind went back to a\nmeeting of the Ballymena Clerical in 1997. Around that time we had invited\nvarious political leaders to talk to our group. At one particular meeting we met\nwith David Allderdyce, then leader of the Alliance Party, who had been\nbrought up in a Presbyterian Manse in Ballymena. In the face of some hostility\nhe had, on the previous day, held his first meeting with Gerry Adams, the\nleader of Sinn Fein. He explained that he had always said he would not meet\nGerry Adams until the IRA declared a ceasefire. The ceasefire had held for\nover three months, so he had agreed to meet with Gerry Adams. He then went\non to talk of his hopes for a developing peace in Northern Ireland. We asked\nhim what role he saw for the Churches in Northern Ireland. I will never forget\nhis reply. \u2018Too often in the past,\u2019 he said, \u2018the churches had acted as chaplains\nto the tribes rather than as prophets declaring the sometimes uncomfortable,\noften unpopular, \u2018Thus says the Lord.\u2019\u2019\nThe sometimes uncomfortable, often unpopular, \u2018Thus says the Lord.\u2019 \u2013 is this\nwhere we begin to get a handle on what Jesus is saying in his difficult words.\nJesus teaching is often inspiring, frequently comforting but on occasions it is\nunashamedly challenging. His commands to forgive, to welcome the outsider,\nto take a stand on issues of justice, on morality can seem hard, can be hard.\nThat can put us at odds with people we love and respect; with friends, with\npeople in power.\nPage 3 of 3\nPROPER 15 \u2013 Year C \u2013 2016 \u2013 Trinity 15\nThis can happen at a number of levels. It can be in the School playground \u2013 do\nwe stand by the one being bullied or do we just quietly stay in the background?\nIn the face of prejudice be it on the basis of gender, race, class, sexual\norientation do we just stay quiet, or do we speak up? For fear of being branded\nas \u2018narrow minded\u2019 it is all too easy to fall in with the crowd on issues of\nmorality.\nTo go back to the language of the PR man \u2013 we can very easily find ourselves\ngoing \u2018Off Message\u2019. For the sake of the quiet life, for the sake of not being\nout on a limb, for the sake of not wanting to be seen as different, we stay quiet,\nwe go with the crowd.\nJust after I came here I recall one of you saying to me, \u2018If we are not different\nthen we are irrelevant.\u2019 Sometimes our faith, our discipleship is going to find\nus out on a limb and, yes, divided from those we trust, admire, those we love.\nThat does not mean we are called to be arrogant, it does not mean we have to\nbe rude or antagonistic. We are simply called to be faithful, faithful to Christ,\nfaithful to ourselves. A number of years ago there was a practice among many\nyoung Christians to wear a wristband, with WWJD \u2013 which stands for \u2018What\nwould Jesus do?\u2019 The idea behind it was very simple; if you found yourself in\na situation where you were not sure what was the right step to take, the\ninscription would serve as a simple reminder to reflect, to pray.\nOur faithfulness can serve as an encouragement to others to be faithful.
