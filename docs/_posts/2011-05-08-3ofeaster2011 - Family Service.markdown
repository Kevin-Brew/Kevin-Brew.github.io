3rd Sunday of Easter - 2011 - Family Service

How would you describe a painter, a postman, a bus driver? We recognise them not by how big or small they are, the sound of their voice but by what they do.

The disciples on the road to Emmaus did not recognise the stranger as he walked alongside them - they did not recognise his voice, even how he looked but they saw who he was when he did something - when he broke the bread.

Jesus did not always do things that other people wanted him to do sometimes his disciples thought they knew best what Jesus should do - stay here, the people like you - you are doing well. Don't go near Jerusalem - they are not nice.

If we are going to be followers of Jesus we have to learn to do and say the things he would want us to do.

> Christ has no body but yours,
> No hands, no feet on earth but yours,
> Yours are the eyes with which he looks
> Compassion on this world,
> Yours are the feet with which he walks to do good,
> Yours are the hands, with which he blesses all the world.
> Yours are the hands, yours are the feet,
> Yours are the eyes, you are his body.

Christ has no body now but yours,
No hands, no feet on earth but yours,
Yours are the eyes with which he looks compassion on this world.
Christ has no body now on earth but yours.

May each one of us be recognized this week as a follower of Jesus.
