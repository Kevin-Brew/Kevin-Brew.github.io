    "blurb": "Kevin reflects on the concept of being chosen, drawing parallels between the selection process in sports and God's selection of individuals. He emphasizes that everyone is special and has a purpose in God's eyes, using Paul's second letter to the Thessalonians and the call of Jeremiah as scriptural references. The sermon reassures that we are all chosen by God, and therefore, should be special to one another.",
    "raw_text": "Anyone see the rugby match yesterday?\nDidn't England do well? No, I think we were all watching the Ireland match.\nBefore the game, we were all waiting to see who was going to be on the team \u2013 who was going to be left out.\n\nI want to start by thinking a bit about this business of picking teams. In youth club, I notice Tim goes down the line 1 \u2013 2 \u2013 1 \u2013 2 \u2013 1 \u2013 2. Not always the way it is done \u2013 some of you may have experienced something like this:\n\n> Video \u2013 Jeremy Lin Picked last\n\nThe man left feeling left out, humiliated, that he didn't matter to anyone. Our second lesson, Paul's 2nd letter to the Thessalonians, has a very different message. God picked you out as his from the very start. Each of us matters, each of us is special in God's sight. I often find myself thinking back on two passages of Scripture and the context in which I heard them, that bring this home to me.\n\nThe first was in the context of a sermon that Desmond Tutu preached at a service in Capetown, long before the end of the Apartheid regime in South Africa. He quoted from the call of Jeremiah.\n\n> Jer 1:5 \"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you,\nand before you were born I consecrated you;\nI appointed you a prophet to the nations.\"\n\nJeremiah, you were no accident; Jeremiah you mean something to me; Jeremiah I have a purpose for you.\n\nAll of you, young, not so young, male, female, tall, not so tall, thin, not so thin \u2013 none of you is an accident, all of you are special, special to God, special to those who love you.\n\nThe other passage I think of comes from Jesus' teaching to his disciples on the night before he died. He says to them, 'You did not choose me, I chose you, that you should bear fruit, fruit that will last.'\n\nEach of us chosen, each of us special to God, each of us having a purpose in God's sight.\n\nIf you are special to God and you are special to God, and you are special to God \u2013 that should mean that we are special to each other.",
