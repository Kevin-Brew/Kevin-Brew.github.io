    "blurb": "This sermon from 2015 discusses the concept of discipleship and what it means to follow Jesus. Drawing parallels between the biblical disciples and modern day followers, the sermon emphasizes that Jesus is not looking for casual followers but for committed disciples who are willing to leave everything behind. The sermon also contrasts the idea of following Jesus with following someone on social media, highlighting the depth and commitment required in discipleship.",
    "raw_text": "2nd Sunday of Epiphany \u2013 year B \u2013 2015 \u2013 Family Service\n\n'Disciples - Following in the footsteps of Jesus\u2019\n\nWell here we are at the beginning of 2015. Christmas is now well behind us. Back then we were listening to the story of the birth of Jesus. We are now starting to follow the story of Jesus the man. Last Sunday in Church we read about his baptism by John the Baptist in the River Jordan. Now we are starting to read about how he began to gather a group of people around him, his disciples.\n\nWhen Jesus said to someone, \u2018Follow me?\u2019 \u2013 what made them follow? Some like Andrew and Peter and Philip seemed keen from the word go \u2013 there was something about Jesus. Others weren\u2019t quite so keen. Nathaniel wasn\u2019t too impressed with the town Jesus came from \u2013 Messiah from Nazareth \u2013 you cannot be serious. But even Nathaniel when he met Jesus was impressed.\n\nBut why? These men left their jobs, their homes, their families to follow Jesus. Following Jesus was a serious business \u2013 serious for them, serious for Jesus. What did it mean?\n\nComing to our own day, when we talk of following a lot of people will be thinking of Facebook. For the few who haven\u2019t heard of Facebook, people will establish their own page. And then people will start to contact you saying they would like to be friends, they would like to follow you on Facebook \u2013 read about what you think, what you like, what you had for breakfast. You could end up with lots of people following you.\n\nFollowing Jesus is not like following someone on Facebook. Jesus isn\u2019t looking for people who are vaguely curious about him.\n\nGoing back to the Facebook page. If we like the look of someone\u2019s page, or something on their page \u2013 it might be a photo or something they have written \u2013 you can not just say you are following them.\n\nAgain this does not really match up to what following Jesus means. He\u2019s not looking for someone who is curious about him, he\u2019s not even looking for someone who admires him.\n\nJesus is looking for disciples. Jesus is looking for friends. At the end of his ministry, on the night before he died, Jesus said this to the men who had followed him, who had heard him teach, seen him heal:\n\n> You are my friends when you do the things I command you.\n> I\u2019m no longer calling you servants because servants don\u2019t understand what their master is thinking and planning. No, I\u2019ve named you friends because I\u2019ve let you in on everything I\u2019ve heard from the Father.\n> \u201cYou didn\u2019t choose me, remember; I chose you, and put you in the world to bear fruit, fruit that won\u2019t spoil. John 15:14ff\n\nPeople who want to listen to what he has to say, who want to learn, who want to walk in the footsteps of Jesus, who want to used by Jesus in the building of his Kingdom \u2013 he is looking for me and for you to be his disciples.",
