    "blurb": "This sermon is part of a series on the Fruits of the Spirit, focusing on gentleness. It discusses how gentleness and self-control are not innate, but are fruits of the Spirit that come from allowing God's Holy Spirit to live and work within us. It emphasizes that Christian life is not always easy, and that it involves pain, sacrifice, and misunderstanding. The sermon also explores the barriers to gentleness, such as pride and wilfulness.",
    "raw_text": "# Fruits of the Spirit: Gentleness\n\nThis sermon is part of a series on the Fruits of the Spirit as listed by Paul: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. We have looked at Love, joy, patience as we find them in Scripture, as we find them in God \u2013 attributes we should expect to see in ourselves as we seek to follow God.\n\nHow about gentleness and self control \u2013 how are we on those \u2013 how can we encourage in others those gifts we find so hard ourselves? Christian life is not always easy. God\u2019s love was a \u2018Calvary love\u2019 \u2013 love that involved pain, sacrifice, misunderstanding \u2013 Christian life, Christian discipleship has that Calvary element to it.\n\nDietrich Boenhoffer used to talk of \u2018cheap grace\u2019. Paul talks of the old self having been crucified with Christ. Crucifixion is ugly and brutal, long and painful \u2013 once the victim is secured to the cross the final outcome is in no doubt.\n\nSo there are times when Christian pilgrimage is not easy, times when I fail, when the old self reasserts itself. Times of isolation, of misunderstanding. Christ will not leave me, the end of my pilgrimage is secure.\n\nThese are fruits of the Spirit \u2013 not of my own self discipline or effort. It does not depend on me. Gentleness and self control do not automatically well up within me, cannot be induced by my discipline \u2013 only come to the extent I am prepared to allow God\u2019s Holy Spirit to live and work in and through me.\n\nHoly Spirit inspires all that is good in mankind \u2013 enables me to become more like Jesus. Fruits of the Spirit are characteristics of those who have grasped the reality of God\u2019s love in Christ \u2013 an inner conversion of heart and soul not the grudging payments of a deal.\n\nLives changed by the totally gracious love of God in Christ \u2013 our lives, in all their imperfection, bear witness to Christ living in us. Gentleness of Christ is manifested in humility \u2013 emptied himself, taking the form of a servant.\n\nOne of barriers to gentleness is our pride, our dignity \u2013 hard to be proud and to be gentle \u2013 model of the father\u2019s reaction to the returning prodigal. Gentleness, not pride, is a fruit of the spirit. Gentleness of Christ is shown in obedience, even death on a cross.\n\nAnother barrier to gentleness is our own wilfulness \u2013 what I want, what I think. We have to discover the lesson of Gethsemene \u2018 Not my will but yours be done\u2019. Next week is Holy Week \u2013 drawn into a deeper understanding of God\u2019s love for us in Christ.",
