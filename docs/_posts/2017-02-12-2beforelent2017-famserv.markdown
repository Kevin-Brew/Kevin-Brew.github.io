2nd Sunday before Epiphany – 2017 – Family Service (Need powerpoint)

Just started Confirmation Group
Explore whole idea of faith – who or what is God, what does God mean for me
This Sunday, 2nd before Lent, theme of creation.
God as creator – lesson from Genesis – pictures on screen.
After – Burrow song ‘Our God is a great big God’
‘He’s wider than the Universe and beyond ……’
Doesn’t stop there:
‘He’s known me and he’s loved me ……’
God who creates not indifferent to us – knows, loves and cares
This is where our Gospel reading came in:
Don’t worry about what you eat……… Your heavenly father knows
A God who creates – who knows, who listens, who understands

This is brought together in this quote by Albert Einstein …… one of the all time giants of the scientific world.

>I want to know how God created this world. I'm not interested in this or that phenomenon, in the spectrum of this or that element. I want to know His thoughts, the rest are details.

If you want to know something, if you want to know somebody – you have to watch, you have to listen.
That’s why I like that drama we just had of the Lord’s Prayer
The God who creates – a God who listens, who understands us, who speaks and inspires us.
That is a God who is real – that is the God we are trying to get to know better in our journey towards Confirmation.
