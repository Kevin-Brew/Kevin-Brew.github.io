    "raw_text": "Funeral of Mrs Doris Blennerhassett \u2013 16th July 2012\n\nOver the last seven years I have been in Howth, I have often been asked; \u2018Do you ever hear of Doris Blennerhassett?\u2019 This question will be followed by recollections of Doris. Then, on the occasions I called into Delgean Nursing Home in Dundalk, I would have been asked, \u2018How is the Parish? I love getting the Newsletter.\u2019 Then memories shared of the Rectory, the Parish, the people \u2013 and of course Frank. What I have come to realise is that there was a genuine affection not just for Doris as \u201cthe Rector\u2019s wife\u201d but for Doris as a person in her own right. There was an affection on her part for this community in which she has lived for over forty years, the people of the Parish, the neighbours on the Howth Road.\n\nBorn in Glasnevin, her family had been members of St George\u2019s Parish. A young Curate came to the Parish by the name of Frank Blennerhassett. They were married just short of Doris\u2019 21st birthday. So began a life long partnership as she supported Frank in his ministry in Balbriggan (where they spent 15 years) and here in Howth, where Frank was Rector for 32 years.\n\nAs I said, she is remembered with great affection in this place \u2013 as someone said to me on Sunday, \u2018Doris Blennerhassett was a genuinely nice person.\u2019 Talking to Monsignor Houlihan, the Parish of the Assumption remember Frank and Doris with affection. When I asked the family how they would want her remembered, the immediate response was, \u2018A wonderful mother and grandmother.\u2019 She, for her part, took a great delight in her family.\n\nAs the family went through her belongings, they came across her Prayer Book, which had, slipped in at the back, requests for her funeral. There were the hymns we are singing today and the readings. There were some prayers she did not want used along with the prayer that is printed on the front of the service sheet.\n\nCalm me O Lord as thou stilled the storm.\nStill me O Lord, keep me from harm.\nLet all the tumult within me cease.\nEnfold me, O Lord, in thy peace.\n\nFavourite hymns, favourite prayers tell us a lot about the person. As I read this prayer I sense a spirituality that took Doris through some of her own hard times; a spirituality that enabled Doris to support Frank through his. There is a warmth here that was apparent to so many who knew her; to her children Rowland, Wendy, Kathryn and Miriam and their families, mourning the death of a beloved mother and grandmother; to this Parish and wider community.\n\nShe worked for a while as Matron in Mount Temple School \u2013 one former pupil recalling to one of Doris\u2019 children \u2018a wiper of tears and blotter of cut knees\u2019. A humanity that has enriched people in ways I would suspect Doris, in her innate modesty, may not have acknowledged.\n\nWe gather today, on the day of her funeral, to thank God for Doris for all that was good and true in her life, for that simple spirituality, for the many ways in which her life has enriched our own and to commend this gentle soul to the loving care of Almighty God.\n\nThose of us outside the immediate family circle have come today to thank God for Doris and also to show our love and support to those who will miss her most, Rowland, Wendy, Kathryn and Miriam and their families. The family I know would also want to thank the staff and community of Delgean Nursing Home for their wonderful care for Doris over these last six years and I know that Doris greatly valued their love and care.\n\nIt is our hope and prayer that as you remember your mother and grandmother that the very proper sadness you feel at this time may be softened by memories of times past, of love, of understanding; that something of Doris\u2019 faith in the face of all that life brought her way may strengthen and inspire your own.\n\nOn a day such as this we gather to give thanks for the one we have loved, to pray for those who will miss her most. We also gather in the face of death, in the face of our own mortality, to proclaim our faith that Christ is risen, that death is not the end.\n\nThat is our hope and prayer for Doris and for ourselves this day.\n\nDoris and Frank spent so much of their life together here in Howth. I will just close with a parable of immortality that draws together themes of the sea and of our Christian hope:\n\nI am standing by the seashore.\nA ship at my side spreads her white sails to the morning breeze and starts for the blue ocean.\nShe is an object of beauty and strength, and I stand and watch until at last she hangs like a speck of white cloud just where the sun and sky come down to mingle with each other.\nThen someone at my side says, \u2018There she goes! \u2018\nGone where? Gone from my sight - that is all.\nShe is just as large in mast and hull and spar as she was when she left my side and just as able to bear her load of living freight to the places of destination.\nHer diminished size is in me, not in her.\nAnd just at the moment when someone at my side says, \u2018There she goes!\u2019, there are other eyes watching her coming, and other voices ready to take up the glad shout :\n\u2018Here she comes!\u2019\nby Henry van Dyke",

That is a theme that has run through the hymns, the psalm\nand the lessons that Doris has chosen for today. With the psalmist we have\nproclaimed:\n2.

I am the\nAlpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.
