    "blurb": "This sermon from Easter Sunday in 2019 focuses on the theme of healing and health. It explores the question of whether anyone would prefer sickness to health, and uses the story of Jesus healing a man at the Pool of Beth-zatha as a central narrative. The sermon emphasizes the importance of faith and the desire for healing.",
    "raw_text": "6th Sunday of Easter \u2013 Year C \u2013 2019\n\nYou may have heard it said of someone, 'Oh, he/she enjoys bad health.' The implication is that this person rather enjoys the sympathy, the extra attention and even the status conferred on them by their affliction.\n\nLet us just stop for a moment and ask \u2013 would anyone, deep down, prefer sickness to health? Sickness, prolonged sickness, would eat into anyone, into their very being. OK, they might become demanding, even selfish \u2013 but I would still want to ask that question, would anyone, deep down, prefer sickness to health?\n\nWith this in mind, let us turn to our Gospel reading for today. It is set in the context of one of Jesus\u2019 early visits to Jerusalem told to us by the writer of John\u2019s Gospel. The scene is set at the Pool of Beth-zatha, or elsewhere rendered as Bethsaida. It is a large pool set on the outskirts of the old City of Jerusalem, that is visible to this day, having been recently uncovered by archaeologists. Depending which name you choose from the texts, this can either mean \u2018house of pity\u2019 or \u2018house of mercy\u2019. There was a tradition attached to this place that periodically an angel would trouble the waters and the first person who managed to make it down into the water at that point would be healed of whatever was their affliction.\n\nIn our Gospel reading, our story focusses on two individuals. There is Jesus on what is one of his early trips to Jerusalem for one of the Jewish Festivals. The other is a man, unable to walk, who had been sick for 38 years. We are told Jesus asks him, \u2018Do you want to be made well?\u2019\n\nThis would seem to be a straightforward enough. Who would not want to be made well. The answer is more complex. You can sense a frustration in the man\u2019s reply. Referring ot the tradition of the waters being troubled; \u2018I\u2019ve no-one to help me into the pool when the water is troubled. When I do get there it is always too late.\u2019",

    "prompt": "Create a black and white pencil drawing of a serene garden with a central, ornate fountain that has a gentle flow of water. In the foreground, depict a single, withered tree with a few leaves sprouting, symbolizing the beginning of healing and renewal. Nearby, a diverse array of people from all walks of life, represented by their silhouettes, are sitting or standing, some reaching out towards the fountain with expressions of hope and anticipation. Include a variety of plants and flowers in various stages of bloom around the garden, representing the potential for growth and recovery. The overall atmosphere should be one of tranquility and the promise of rejuvenation, without any explicit religious symbols or figures.",
    "summary": "Based on the provided text, here are the top four concepts from the sermon:\n\n1. The human condition and its relationship with suffering: The sermon begins by questioning the notion that someone might prefer sickness over health due to the attention it brings, leading to a deeper reflection on the nature of suffering and the human desire for health and well-being.\n\n2. The desire for healing: This concept is central to the Gospel reading, where the focus is on the desire for physical and perhaps spiritual healing, as exemplified by the man who has been unable to walk for 38 years.\n\n3. The role of faith and divine intervention: The Pool of Beth-zatha (or Bethsaida) represents a place of hope and faith where people believed in the healing power of the waters, especially when they were \"troubled\" by an angel.\n\n4. The challenge of receiving help: The man's frustration at not being able to reach the healing waters in time reflects the difficulties that people face in seeking and receiving help, whether due to physical limitations, social isolation, or other barriers.\n\nFor a non-religious black and white pencil diagram that can be graphically represented, I would select the concept of \"The desire for healing.\" This concept can be universally understood and is not inherently religious, allowing for a visual representation that can resonate with a wide audience.\n\nHere's a detailed prompt for DALL-E 3 to create an image based on the concept of \"The desire for healing\":\n\n\"Create a black and white pencil drawing of a serene garden with a central, ornate fountain that has a gentle flow of water.
