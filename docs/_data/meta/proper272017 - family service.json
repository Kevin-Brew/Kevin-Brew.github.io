    "blurb": "The sermon 'Let Your Light Shine' emphasizes the importance of letting the love of God shine through us in all that we do. It draws a parallel between fireflies being recognized by their light and how people can recognize us by the light of God within us. The message encourages us to be consistent in our faith, not just on Sundays but every day, and to show which side we are on by our actions and dedication.",
    "raw_text": "2nd Sunday before Advent \u2013 Year A (Family Service)\n\nLet your light shine\n\nTeacher:\nHi Sunny. How are you today?\n\nSunny:\nI\u2019m doing great! I just got back from visiting my grandmother.\n\nTeacher:\nThat sounds like fun.\n\nSunny:\nIt was. I had a great time.\n\nTeacher:\nWhat did you do?\n\nSunny:\nI got to go out in her backyard to catch fireflies. The only problem was I needed a jar first, and I couldn\u2019t find one.\n\nTeacher:\nOh, really?\n\nSunny:\nAll I could find was a new jar of peanut butter. So I asked Grandma if I could make us some sandwiches.\n\nTeacher:\nBut two sandwiches won\u2019t empty out a full jar of peanut butter.\n\nSunny:\nI know. But 37 will.\n\nTeacher:\nYou didn\u2019t. (Sunny just looks at the Teacher, Teacher sighs) You did.\n\nSunny:\nI brought some back if you want one.\n\nTeacher:\nOk, so you got your jar. Did you catch any fireflies?\n\nSunny:\nNot at first. When I went outside it was still a little light, so I had to wait. That was kind of annoying, because there were these bugs flying all around. But then I saw one.\n\nTeacher:\nA firefly?\n\nSunny:\nYeah, or at least I thought it was. It was a bug, and it was yellow. And I had it right in my hand. The only problem was that it turned out to be a yellow jacket.\n\nTeacher:\n(shudders) Ouch.\n\nSunny:\nYou know when people say that yellow jackets will only bother you if you bother them first? Well, I guess that bothered him!\n\nTeacher:\nSo what did you do?\n\nSunny:\nSomething kind of like this. (starts bouncing up and down) AAAAAH! OUCH! OUCH! GRANDMA! AAAAH!\n\nTeacher:\nDid you stop after that?\n\nSunny:\nNo, after Grandma looked at my hand I went back out. And those bugs were still flying around. It was getting dark by now, so they got out their flashlights.\n\nTeacher:\nWho? The bugs?\n\nSunny:\nThat\u2019s what I thought at first. They were flying around everywhere, and they reminded me of little sparks of fire. Flying fire. Fire that flies. Then it hit me, those were fireflies!\n\nTeacher:\nNo kidding.\n\nSunny:\nNo, they really were! I\u2019m so smart.\n\nTeacher:\nHow did you know?\n\nSunny:\nBecause of their lights.\n\nTeacher:\nDid you know, people can tell who we are by our light too.\n\nSunny:\n(looking out at the kids) You mean they light up too? This I\u2019ve want to see!\n\nTeacher:\nBut we don\u2019t light up the same way the bugs do. Jesus said to let our light shine. We do that by letting the love of God shine through us in all that we do. That\u2019s how we can let people know that we have Him in our hearts.\n\nSunny:\nSounds like a bright idea. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I think I\u2019ll go have a sandwich.\n\nStay with this idea of people knowing who we are.\n\nAnyone at the Aviva last night? Anyone wearing a South African shirt?\n\nPeople want to show who they support \u2013 people in Ireland and South Africa shirts.\n\nIn our Old Testament lesson \u2013 Joshua asking people \u2018Whose side are you on?\u2019 Which gods are you going to serve?\n\nAs for me and my household \u2013 we will serve the Lord.\n\nNext Sunday including 2 baptisms in our service of dedication.\n\nAt the heart of the service of Baptism is the question \u2018Do you turn to Christ?\u2019 \u2013 whose side are you on? Who are you going to serve?\n\nArchbishop will be back in February for the Service of Confirmation.\n\nThis time he will be asking these questions not of the parents and godparents of 2 babies \u2013 he will be asking them of our confirmation candidates.\n\nOur classes are now underway and a couple of the class have been helping this morning. Over the next few weeks we will be thinking through the questions the Archbishop will be asking, what it means to be a follower of Jesus.\n\nAs the puppet show demonstrated \u2013 we know a firefly by the light that it shines.\n\nGospel reading reminds us of the importance of letting our light shine \u2013 not just sometimes but all the time.\n\nFollowing Jesus not a part time business \u2013 not just something we do on a Sunday \u2013 we do it from the moment we get up to the moment we go to sleep.",
