## PROPER 21 – 2014 – Year A – Family Communion

Who are our heroes? We admire some not just for what they have done but for who they are. Brian O'Driscoll is not only very skilled but also determined, brave, and a great sportsman. Katie Taylor is a determined great sportswoman who provided a model for young women. Footballers like Packie Bonner, with his save in the 1990 World Cup, inspire us. Our heroes, we admire them; they inspire us; we want to be like them.

One of my heroes taught me that faith and science could be held together. In the Philippians Passage, the 'I' crossed out represents The Cross.
