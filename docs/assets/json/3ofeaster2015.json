    "blurb": "In this sermon, Kevin Brew discusses the concept of identity, particularly as it relates to being a child of God. He emphasizes that our fundamental identity as God's children is unchangeable and pre-dates all other identities we may have. He also highlights that our Christian life is a continual response to this identity.",
    "raw_text": "Back in 1968, when I came to Dublin to study in Trinity, there were a number of cultural differences between Dublin and my native Birmingham that struck me as I began to settle down. The first one was that of what amounted to a \u2018mixed marriage\u2019. I recall my land lady in Blackrock saying with some satisfaction that none of her sons were involved in a mixed marriage. In Birmingham a mixed marriage was inter racial. Dublin in 1968 did not have a large overseas population and for a moment I was left wondering were there whole areas of Dublin of which I was unaware with a large overseas population.\n\nThe other one that intrigued me at the time was in the area of people\u2019s names. I got to know two students, who were brother and sister who seemed to have different surnames. There was Owen Mac Egoin and his sister Niamh Nic Egoin until Owen explained to this Sassenach blow the obvious significance of the Mac and the Nic \u2013 son of and daughter of.\n\nIt brought home to me that our identity as son or daughter has it is origins prior to our birth. I did not choose who was to be my father. From the very moment of my birth I was my father\u2019s son, my mother\u2019s child. That fundamental identity pre-dated everything else that may distinguish me; graduate of Trinity, husband of Rachel, father of Anthony and Benjamin, priest in the Church of Ireland, Rector of Mountmellick, of Ahoghill, Rector of Howth. There is an essential \u201cme\u201d that underlines all of these.\n\nI was born the son of Gilbert and Kathleen Brew and that sonship can never be taken away. My family might disown me but that fundamental identity can never be erased. We share another fundamental identity with all humanity when we declare that we are all made in the image of God. That means that there is an intrinsic dignity to all humanity, irrespective of race, class, creed, gender that challenges attitudes of prejudice at any level. There is something of the divine in each and every one of us. It may be obscured at times by our weakness and failure but it is still there.\n\nJohn takes this one stage further in the wonderful words of the Prologue of the 4th Gospel that we read each year at Christmas.\n\n12 But to all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God, 13 who were born, not of blood or of the will of the flesh or of the will of man, but of God. John 1:12,13\n\n\u2018He gave power to become children of God.\u2019 This affirmation is echoed in our reading from the First Letter of John, as the writer speaks of this fundamental identity we have in Christ.\n\n2Beloved, we are God\u2019s children now; what we will be has not yet been revealed. What we do know is this: when he is revealed, we will be like him, for we will see him as he is. 1 John 3:2\n\nAs I read that this week, I found myself turning to a book on my shelves by Michael Ramsey, who was Archbishop of Canterbury, when I was a teenager and student. Writing in the context of Baptism, he says\n\nBaptism \u2026 declares that the beginning of a man\u2019s Christianity is not what he feels and experiences and what God in Christ has done for him. \u2026 The life of a Christian is a continual response to the fact of his Baptism; he continually learns that he has died and risen with Christ, and that his life is a part of the life of the one family.\n\nThe Gospel and the Catholic Church. Michael Ramsey pp59,60\n\nI spoke earlier of my identity as something that pre-dated me. I was born the son of Gilbert and Kathleen Brew, an identity that predated me as graduate of Trinity, husband of Rachel, father of Anthony and Benjamin, priest of the Church of Ireland. If you like all these latter things are built upon, have grown out of that essential sonship that is me.\n\nWhat Michael Ramsey is reminding us is that the beginning of my Christian life lies not in anything I can do or offer \u2013 it has its beginnings in what God has done in Christ. My Christian life is lived in response to that initial gift of God in Christ. So, in the words of the 1st Letter of John:\n\n2Beloved, we are God\u2019s children now; what we will be has not yet been revealed.\n\nMy Christian life is a process of discovering what that means; what it means, in the words of the Baptism Service, to die to sin, what it means to rise to new life in Christ \u2013 in and through this complex and strange person that is Kevin Brew.\n\nMoreover as daughters and sons of God, we are called to live out our childhood of God as witnesses in our own generation of the risen Christ. At the end of a service of Baptism I will say to the child:\n\nYou have received the light of Christ.\n\nWalk in this light all the days of your life.\n\nShine as a light in the world to the glory of God the Father.\n\nThat is what we are called to do, to shine as a light in this world, in our homes, in our schools and places of work. As a community and as individuals to be living signs of reconciliation in the places of discord, of integrity and truth in the face of falsehood, of love in the places of hate, of hope in places of fear., to be daughters and sons of God, to be Christ in the world of today.",

    "summary": "From the sermon provided, here are the top four concepts:\n\n1. **Identity and Heritage**: The speaker reflects on their own identity as the son of Gilbert and Kathleen Brew, emphasizing the importance of one's origins and the identities that are ascribed to us from birth, such as family names and cultural heritage.\n\n2. **Intrinsic Dignity and Divine Image**: The sermon discusses the idea that all humans are made in the image of God, which bestows an intrinsic dignity upon every person, regardless of race, class, creed, or gender. This concept challenges prejudices and promotes the recognition of the divine within each individual.\n\n3. **Children of God**: The concept of being children of God as described in the Christian faith, where identity as God's children is given through faith and belief, not through blood or heritage. This spiritual sonship is a central theme in the sermon, highlighting a fundamental identity in Christ.\n\n4. **Christian Life as a Response and Witness**: The Christian life is portrayed as a continual response to the gift of God in Christ. It involves a process of growth and discovery, dying to sin, and rising to new life. Christians are called to shine as a light in the world, living as witnesses of the risen Christ and embodying values of reconciliation, integrity, truth, love, and hope.\n\nFor a non-religious black and white pencil diagram that can be graphically represented, the concept of \"Intrinsic Dignity and Divine Image\" seems most suitable. It is universal and can be depicted without religious symbols.\n\n**Detailed Prompt for DALL-E 3:**\n\n\"Create a black and white pencil drawing that captures the essence of intrinsic human dignity and the divine spark within all individuals. The image should feature a diverse group of people from various backgrounds and walks of life standing together in unity.
