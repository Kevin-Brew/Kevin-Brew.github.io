    "raw_text": "6th Sunday of Easter \u2013 2015 \u2013 year B \u2013 Preconfirmation\n\nThis has been a week of remembering \u2013 earlier in the week there was the official memorial service for those who died in the 1916 Rising. Over this weekend right across Europe people have been remembering \u2013 remembering the end of the war in Europe in 1945, 70 years ago.\n\nSo I want to ask a few \u2018Do you remember\u2019 questions\n\nDo you remember - the first time you rode a bicycle, the day you learned to swim?\nDo you remember your first day at work?\nDo you remember your wedding day?\nDo you remember your Baptism? - we are remembering who we belong to.\n\nNext Sunday 7 of our young people are being confirmed along with youngsters from Clontarf and Raheny & Coolock in Clontarf . I just want to say now that these young people have been a tremendous group to work with.\n\nDo you remember your own confirmation? The day of taking for ourselves the promises of Baptism.\n\nI certainly remember mine \u2013 I was not confirmed until I was 17. As it turns out our Gospel reading this morning includes the text the Bishop of Aston used in his sermon at my Confirmation in St Lawrence\u2019s Northfield.\n\n\u2018You did not choose me, I chose you and appointed you.\u2019\n\nOr in the Message translation that we read from \u201cYou didn\u2019t choose me, remember; I chose you, and put you in the world to bear fruit.\u201d\n\nI take two very important lessons from that. The first is that each one of you, each person in this building is special. You didn\u2019t choose me \u2013 I chose you. Special not because we are the best runners, the best person at maths or science or Irish or geography or history, the prettiest or the most handsome- we are all special because God has placed a supreme value on each one of us, the life, the death, the resurrection of Jesus \u2013 God says to each one of us \u2013 \u2018You\u2019re worth that to me.\u2019 \u2013 the rest of my life, of your life is one of learning what that means to each one of us.\n\nThe next lesson I take is that we are put here to make a difference. \u2018remember; I chose you, and put you in the world to bear fruit.\u2019 Over these weeks we\u2019ve been thinking of the difference faith can make to us and how we live our lives. Remember when we were on the commandments. What does it mean to honour your father and your mother \u2013 we always have good discussions on that one! We thought about who Jesus was, what his cross means to us, what forgiveness means.\n\nThen we thought of what difference can people of faith make in the world. We thought of people who had campaigned against racism and oppression, their message was rooted in their deep Christian conviction that racism and oppression was an offence before God \u2013 we thought of Martin Luther King in America, Desmond Tutu in South Africa. In our own country, Gordon Wilson who on the day his daughter died next to him in the aftermath of an IRA bomb in Enniskillen, said he was praying for those who had planted the bomb. That came out of his own deeply held faith.\n\nHow can you or I bring something of God\u2019s love, God\u2019s desire for justice, for peace building, for reconciliation in my school, my place of work, my home, my community.\n\n\u2018You did not choose me, I chose you and appointed you.\u2019\n\nThat stayed with me from the night of my Confirmation. May each one of you grow in your understanding of God\u2019s love for you and your place in his Church \u2013 and may God work in and through each one of you in what ever you do, wherever you live, whoever you marry.\n\nMay your Confirmation next Sunday night be a very special time for each one of you, one that you can look back on, as Jesus says of each one of you:\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t choose me, remember; I chose you, and put you in the world to bear fruit.",

    "prompt": "Create a black and white pencil drawing that depicts a diverse group of people planting trees in a barren landscape. The scene should convey a sense of community and cooperation, with individuals of different ages and backgrounds working together. Each person is nurturing a young sapling, symbolizing hope and the positive impact of collective effort. The background should show a contrast between the barren side and the flourishing side where trees have already grown, representing the transformation brought about by their actions. No religious symbols or text should be present, only the universal imagery of people caring for the environment and contributing to a better future through their collective effort.",
    "summary": "From the sermon provided, the top four concepts appear to be:\n\n1. **Remembrance and History**: The sermon begins by recalling historical events, such as the 1916 Rising and the end of World War II in Europe, emphasizing the importance of remembering the past and significant milestones.\n\n2. **Personal Milestones and Sacraments**: The preacher asks the congregation to remember personal milestones such as riding a bicycle, learning to swim, first day at work, wedding day, and baptism, leading to the theme of confirmation, which is a personal religious milestone.\n\n3. **Divine Choice and Individual Worth**: The sermon highlights the concept that individuals are chosen by God, which bestows upon them a unique worth and value, as evidenced by the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.\n\n4. **Purpose and Making a Difference**: The preacher discusses the idea that people are chosen to bear fruit in the world, to make a difference, and to act on their faith by promoting justice, peace, and reconciliation.\n\nFor a non-religious black and white pencil diagram that can be generated by DALL-E 3, the concept of \"Purpose and Making a Difference\" seems the most suitable as it can be represented in a universal and non-religious manner. Here is a detailed prompt for DALL-E 3:\n\nPrompt for DALL-E 3:\n\"Create a black and white pencil drawing that depicts a diverse group of people planting trees in a barren landscape. The scene should convey a sense of community and cooperation, with individuals of different ages and backgrounds working together. Each person is nurturing a young sapling, symbolizing hope and the positive impact of collective effort. The background should show a contrast between the barren side and the flourishing side where trees have already grown, representing the transformation brought about by their actions. No religious symbols or text should be present, only the universal imagery of people caring for the environment and contributing to a better future through their collective effort.\"\n\nThis prompt translates the concept of making a difference into a universally understandable image of environmental stewardship and community collaboration, which aligns with the sermon's message of being chosen to bear fruit and make a positive impact in the world."
