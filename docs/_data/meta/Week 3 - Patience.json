    "blurb": "This sermon explores the concept of patience as a fruit of the Spirit. It delves into the biblical accounts of God's patience with humanity, Jesus' patience with his disciples, and how patience allows space for healing in relationships. The sermon encourages believers to show the same patience God has shown them, not seeking immediate revenge for wrongs done to them.",
    "raw_text": "Riches of language can lie in the different sayings people have in different parts of the country 'So and so \u2013 wouldn\u2019t he try the patience of a saint?' Idea of someone of great sanctity struggling to keep their cool. What is the patience of a saint? - raised in the passage we have been focusing on this Lent. We read Galatians 5:22-25. Each week we have been looking at how each of these attributes are found in the Bible, in God, in Jesus. Set alongside teaching of Catechism on work of the Holy Spirit.\n\nWe have looked at love, have looked at how we find it in God \u2013 unfailing love, love at full stretch 'My God, my God \u2026.' My love is a response to that love \u2013 if I have not grasped it how can I share it? Last week looked at joy \u2013 how do we find it in the Bible - joy an emotion of harmony, of communion, of being at one with God \u2013 more than just an emotion \u2013 founded on God\u2019s love for us.\n\nThis week we look at patience \u2013 a word, a theme, that recurs over and over again in the Bible. Attribute of God and of the one who would follow God. We go through OT story \u2013 creation, fall, flood, call of Abraham, Exodus, desert wandering, entry into the Promised Land through to David, Solomon, Exile \u2013 right up to the coming of Jesus.\n\nGod persists in continuing love, persists in the face of failure, of disobedience. Man\u2019s failure at no stage frustrated God\u2019s purposes \u2013 God will not allow my sin, my failure, my sin to ultimately stand in his way \u2013 if I fail, God will find someone else. God\u2019s patience is with a people \u2013 does not exclude judgement \u2013 both the patience and the judgement are an outworking of love.\n\nGod\u2019s patience mirrored in the patience of Jesus in the context of his own ministry. Patience with those he called \u2013 think especially of Peter \u2013 enthusiasm, courage, weakness, failure. Clear vision (you are the Christ) coupled with blindness (this will never happen to you) Followed into the courtyard \u2013 yet crumbled \u2013 yet Jesus still trusted (Feed my sheep).\n\nPatience in the New Testament is Greek word \u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 - patience in the face of injury \u2013 implies slowness to avenge injury. We read Matthew 5:38-42. Patience, \u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03af\u03b1, a slowness to avenge injury \u2013 allows space for healing in relationships.\n\nWe see that in the Parable of the Prodigal and in the picture by Rembrandt. We read Luke 15. While the son was still a long way off, the father was waiting patiently, waiting for the son\u2019s return, ready to respond in reconciling love. - reflected in words of Post Communion Prayer \u2013 While we were still a long way off you met us in your son and brought us home \u2026\u2026.. Patience, \u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03af\u03b1, a slowness to avenge injury \u2013 allows space for healing in relationships.\n\nWe offer that space because God has allowed us that space in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us \u2026\u2026 a love that takes the initiative 'Father forgive, for they know not \u2026.' \u2013 leaves time to respond. May God, by the power of the HS enable us to show something of the patience God has shown us. Patience that does not seek immediate revenge for wrongs that are done to us. The patience that recognises that we too have sinned, we too have fallen short of the glory of God. The patience that persists in the face of misunderstanding. In short the patience of a saint.",
