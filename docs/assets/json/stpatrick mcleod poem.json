    "blurb": "This sermon, likely given during Lent, uses vivid imagery to describe the omnipresence of Christ. It emphasizes the belief that Christ is not only above us, but also beneath us, beside us, and within us. The sermon suggests that Christ's presence is not confined to physical temples, but is found in all aspects of creation and within every individual.",
    "raw_text": "Christ above us, Christ beneath us,\nChrist beside us, Christ within us.\nInvisible we see you, Christ above us.\nWith earthly eyes we see above us,\nclouds or sunshine, grey or bright.\nBut with the eye of faith\nwe know you reign,\ninstinct in the sun ray,\nspeaking in the storm,\nwarming and moving all creation,\nChrist above us.\n\nInvisible we see you, Christ beneath us.\nWith earthly eyes we see beneath us\nstones and dust and dross.\nBut with the eyes of faith,\nwe know you uphold.\nIn you\nall things consist and hang together.\nThe very atom is light energy,\nthe grass is vibrant,\nthe rocks pulsate.\nAll is in flux;\nturn but a stone and an angel moves.\nUnderneath are the everlasting arms.\nUnknowable we know you, Christ beneath us.\n\nInapprehensible we know you, Christ beside us.\nWith earthly eyes we see men and women,\nexuberant or dull, tall or small.\nBut with the eye of faith,\nwe know you dwell in each.\nYou are imprisoned in the dope fiend and the\ndrunk,\ndark in the dungeon, but you are there.\nYou are released, resplendent,\nin the loving mother, the passionate bride,\nand in every sacrificial soul.\nInapprehensible we know you, Christ beside us.\n\nIntangible, we touch you, Christ within us.\nWith earthly eyes we see ourselves,\ndust of the dust, earth of the earth.\nBut with the eye of faith,\nwe know ourselves all girt about of eternal stuff,\nour minds capable of Divinity,\nour bodies groaning, waiting for the revealing,\nour souls redeemed, renewed.\nIntangible we touch you, Christ within us.\n\nChrist above us, beneath us,\nbeside us, within us,\nwhat need have we for temples made with hands?",
