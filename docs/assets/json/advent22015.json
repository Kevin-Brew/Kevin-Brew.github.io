    "blurb": "This sermon, delivered on the second Sunday of Advent in 2015, explores the theme of life as a 'work in progress' under God's guidance. Drawing on the words of Philippians 1:6, the sermon underscores the continuous nature of our spiritual journey, likening it to a sacrificial offering in progress. It emphasizes that God is present at every stage of this journey, guiding us towards becoming more like Him.",
    "raw_text": "2nd Sunday of Advent - 2015 - year C\n\n'I am confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.' (Philippians 1:6)\n\nIn the early days of our marriage, we used to have a poster on the wall. It depicted a caterpillar chewing on a leaf, with the caption, 'Be patient with me - God hasn't finished with me yet.' This poster came to my mind as I read over the portion appointed for the Epistle on this second Sunday of Advent, and in particular the words I took as my text,\n\n'I am confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.'\n\nI want to take up this theme of my life before God as 'work in progress', moving towards a fulfilment in God's purposes for me. I suppose what I am doing is continuing my thoughts along the lines of life as a journey. By its very nature, a journey always involves further travel, new territory to be discovered, new truths to be learned. I will often think of the life of faith as a journey into Christ, undertaken in the presence of Christ.\n\nThis idea of the continuing nature of our spiritual life before God is brought out in the technical language that Paul has chosen to use in his letter to the Philippians, the significance of which is lost in the process of translation.\n\nThe Greek word that we have translated as 'to begin' is enarchestai; the one we translate as 'to complete' is epitelein. In the language of the Greek society within which the Christians in Philippi lived, these are words associated with the ceremony of sacrifice in Greek religious life. The whole process of preparation of the sacrificial offering and the worshipper is covered by the term enarchestai and the completion of the whole act of sacrifice is covered by the word epitelein. So Paul is developing the idea of my whole ongoing life before God in terms of a spiritual sacrifice which is part of God's work in my life as much as anything that I may bring to the process.\n\nAs you are no doubt aware of at this stage, over the years I have found myself drawing on the thoughts of Michael Ramsey, who was Archbishop of Canterbury when I began my own exploration of faith. Writing on the whole place of Baptism in the life of the Church he wrote this: 'Baptism declares that a man's Christianity begins not with what he feels or experiences but with what God has done in Christ.' \u2013 We love because he first loved us \u2013 my whole life is lived in response to God in Christ.\n\nGod is there at every stage on my spiritual journey. He was there before I ever set out, there in the person of Jesus ; there as the 'Word became flesh and lived among us full of grace and truth,' in his life and ministry, in his death and resurrection. It is who, who by his Holy Spirit, who was there at the very beginning of my journey, alongside the encouragement of family and friends, awakening in me the first realization of his call.\n\nIt is he who accompanies me along the way, strengthening me in times of weakness and temptation, drawing me back in times of disobedience and failure. Becoming like me, he enables me to become more like him, enabling me to live up to my call to live as one made in the image of God. 'To all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God.'\n\nI began by talking of caterpillars. Within the caterpillar there is all the potential, the beauty, the delicacy, the glory of the butterfly. It is work in progress. I too am work in progress - God has not finished with me yet. There is within each one of us something of the Christ who lived and died that we might live. As we travel this journey of life may we show forth more and more of him who calls us and travels the road with us.\n\n'Christ be beside me,\nChrist be before me,\nChrist be behind me,\nKing of my heart.\nChrist be within me,\nChrist be below me,\nChrist be above me,\nnever to part. (Hymn 611)\n\nHe is indeed the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and end of my pilgrimage, the one in whom I live and dwell and have my being.",
