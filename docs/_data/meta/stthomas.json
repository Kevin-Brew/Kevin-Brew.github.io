    "blurb": "Kevin reflects on the journey of faith using the example of St. Thomas, emphasizing that faith is a work in progress, not a finished product. He highlights the importance of patience and inclusion within the church community, especially as a young child is welcomed into the fellowship through baptism. The sermon encourages understanding and personal growth in faith, drawing parallels between the disciples' experiences and our own spiritual journey.",
    "raw_text": "St Thomas' Day \u2013 Trinity 6 \u2013 year C \u2013 2016\n\nBeginning with our student days and continuing on into the present we have placed a number of posters, cards and cuttings around our house, in the loo, the corridors etc that make us stop and think or smile and very often both. There is one that started life in our student days that was finally left behind, rather bedraggled, in Ahoghill. It was a cartoon picture of a caterpillar working its way through a cabbage leaf, with the caption: 'Please be patient \u2013 God isn't finished with me yet.'\n\nToday, this second Sunday after Trinity, is also St Thomas' Day. I must admit, alongside the figure of Peter, I have always had a particular affection for Thomas. It was Thomas who, in John's account of the teaching in the Upper Room at the last Supper, when Jesus had said, 'You know the way to the place where I am going.' had had the honesty to say 'Lord, we don't know where you are going \u2013 so how can we know the way?' Then in our Gospel reading today, as the disciples enthused over their experience of the risen Lord while Thomas had been away, basically had said 'Lads, I would love to be able to share your belief \u2013 but I can't'. His was not an easy faith \u2013 it was a faith shaped in the midst of uncertainty and at times a deep agony. Early Church tradition would indicate that after the resurrection and the scattering of the Apostles he had travelled on to Parthia and then onto to India, where the Bar Thoma Church, which predates the arrival of western missionaries in India, would claim to have been founded by Thomas.\n\n> That's plain enough, isn't it? You're no longer wandering exiles. This kingdom of faith is now your home country. You're no longer strangers or outsiders. You belong here, with as much right to the name Christian as anyone. Eph 2:19ff\n\nThe Church on earth is a living, growing organism \u2013 as the poster reminds me 'Be patient \u2013 God hasn't finished with me yet.'\n\nWe need to be patient with each other as we each grapple with the faith. In this the disciples provide a great example as they stand by Thomas in his doubting, in his questioning. Thomas was not excluded from the group as a disruptive influence. He was with them in the Upper Room the following week, when he had his own experience of the risen Christ. Easter came a week later for Thomas, but the important thing is that it did come. On that day Thomas expressed his own faith and not a second hand faith. The collective and individual faith of the disciples was a work in progress \u2013 God hadn't finished with them yet.\n\nToday, as we are welcoming a young child into the fellowship of the Church and we will shortly be moving to the Promises which lie at the heart of the Service of Baptism. As I often say on these occasions these are not questions of people who have arrived, who have got it all sorted, they are questions of people on a journey, people with whom God hasn't finished yet.\n\nWe therefore receive and welcome you as a member with us of the body of Christ, as a child of the one heavenly Father, and as an inheritor of the kingdom of God.\n\nWe will pray that he will grow in the faith in which he has been baptised, that he will come to confess it when he comes to be confirmed, that he will bear witness to it by a life of service to others.\n\nMay we as a Church be a place of welcome and inclusion. May we be patient and understanding of one another in our search for faith and meaning in life. May each one of us, in our own time and manner come to our own understanding of the love of God in Christ and find that peace that he alone can give.",

It was a cartoon picture of a caterpillar working its\nway through a cabbage leaf, with the caption: \u2018Please be patient \u2013 God isn\u2019t\nfinished with me yet.\u2019\nToday, this second Sunday after Trinity, is also St Thomas\u2019 Day. I must admit,\nalongside the figure of Peter, I have always had a particular affection for\nThomas. It was Thomas who, in John\u2019s account of the teaching in the Upper\nRoom at the last Supper, when Jesus had said, \u2018You know the way to the place\nwhere I am going.\u2019 had had the honesty to say \u2018Lord, we don\u2019t know where\nyou are going \u2013 so how can we know the way?\u2019 Then in our Gospel reading\ntoday, as the disciples enthused over their experience of the risen Lord while\nThomas had been away, basically had said \u2018Lads, I would love to be able to\nshare your belief \u2013 but I can\u2019t\u2019. His was not an easy faith \u2013 it was a faith\nshaped in the midst of uncertainty and at times a deep agony. Early Church\ntradition would indicate that after the resurrection and the scattering of the\nApostles he had travelled on to Parthia and then onto to India, where the Bar\nThoma Church, which predates the arrival of western missionaries in India,\nwould claim to have been founded by Thomas.\nThis morning, as we welcome a child into the fellowship of the Church in\nBaptism, I just want to pick up a couple of themes from the Epistle and Gospel\nPage 2 of 3\nSt Thomas\u2019 Day \u2013 Trinity 6 \u2013 year C \u2013 2016\nset for this St Thomas\u2019s Day. First let us look at the portion from the letter to\nthe Ephesians.\nThat\u2019s plain enough, isn\u2019t it? You\u2019re no longer wandering exiles. This\nkingdom of faith is now your home country. You\u2019re no longer\nstrangers or outsiders. You belong here, with as much right to the\nname Christian as anyone.; Eph 2:19ff\nYou\u2019re no longer wandering exiles. This kingdom of faith is now your home\ncountry. Archbishop McAdoo, who ordained me back in 1978, used to talk of\nthe importance of becoming what we are. The Church of God, and us as\nmembers of that Church are not a finished work, we are a work in progress. As\nthe writer of the Epistle reminds us, as he goes on to speak of the Church,\nGod is building a home. He\u2019s using us all\u2014irrespective of how we got\nhere\u2014in what he is building.\nThe Church on earth is a living, growing organism \u2013 as the poster reminds me\n\u2018Be patient \u2013 God hasn\u2019t finished with me yet.\u2019\nWe need to be patient with each other as we each grapple with the faith. In this\nthe disciples provide a great example as they stand by Thomas in his doubting,\nin his questioning. Think for a moment of John\u2019s account of the reaction of the\nrest of the disciples when Thomas poured cold water on their joy on seeing the\nLord. Thomas was not excluded from the group as a disruptive influence. He\nwasn\u2019t relegated to a proverbial \u2018back row\u2019 for unbelievers. John makes quite\nclear that Thomas remained part of the group, he was with them in the Upper\nRoom the following week, when he had his own experience of the risen Christ.\nI often say Easter came a week later for Thomas, but the important thing is that\nit did come. On that day Thomas expressed his own faith and not a second\nhand faith. The collective and individual faith of the disciples was a work in\nprogress \u2013 God hadn\u2019t finished with them yet.\nPage 3 of 3\nSt Thomas\u2019 Day \u2013 Trinity 6 \u2013 year C \u2013 2016\nToday, as I say, we are welcoming a young child into the fellowship of the\nChurch and we will shortly be moving to the Promises which lie at the heart of\nthe Service of Baptism. As I often say on these occasions these are not\nquestions of people who have arrived, who have got it all sorted, they are\nquestions of people on a journey, people with whom God hasn\u2019t finished yet.\nIn the course of the service we as a congregation will be expressing our\nsolidarity, first with the parents and godparents as they make their response of\nfaith on behalf of Adam; then we will welcome him into the fellowship of the\nChurch in this place, as fellow travellers with us on the journey into faith.\nWe therefore receive and welcome you\nas a member with us of the body of Christ,\nas a child of the one heavenly Father,\nand as an inheritor of the kingdom of God.\nWe will pray that he will grow in the faith in which he has been baptised, that\nhe will come to confess it when he comes to be confirmed, that he will bear\nwitness to it by a life of service to others.\nIt is here the picture of Thomas comes to my mind. Thomas was not\ndragooned into a faith he could not honestly share. He was allowed space to\nthink, to reflect until he came to his own particular experience of the risen\nChrist. May we as a Church be a place of welcome and inclusion. May we be\npatient and understanding of one another in our search for faith and meaning in\nlife. May each one of us, in our own time and manner come to our own\nunderstanding of the love of God in Christ and find that peace that he alone can\ngive."
