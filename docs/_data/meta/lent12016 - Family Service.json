    "blurb": "On Valentine's Day, which also marks the first day of Lent, the sermon explores the concept of love. It emphasizes the importance of showing love through actions, not just words. It also highlights the need to show love for God by caring for the world He has given us.",
    "raw_text": "Today is Valentine\u2019s Day and also the first day of Lent. The first lesson tells people what they are to do when they first enter the land God is giving them. God had shown his love by rescuing them from slavery in Egypt \u2013 this is going to be a way of saying not just thank you to God but saying \u2018I love you\u2019. The second lesson is the story of Jesus being tempted in the wilderness \u2013 Jesus is showing he loves God more than anything else the tempter can offer him.\n\nHow do we show our love to people we care about? Is a messy bedroom saying \u2018Mum, I really love you\u2019? Of course its not just little people throw tantrums. So its not enough just to say \u2018I love you\u2019 to someone we love \u2013 we have to show that love in the way we treat them, in the way we speak to them, in the way we appreciate them.\n\nIt is the same with God. We say we love God \u2013 we need to think a bit about how we show that. We come to Church this morning to sing our praises, to pray for ourselves and for other people \u2013 and that is important. But God wants more than that \u2013 In the Bible we read \u2018If anyone says he loves God and hates his brother he is a liar\u2019 God really does care about how we treat one another.\n\nGod has given us this wonderful world to live in \u2013 like that messy bedroom we have messed it up. So this Sunday we are thinking of love, our love for one another and our love for God. On Valentines day we think of how we show our love to those who are special to us. Today we are invited to do something practical to show our love for God in doing something tidy up this particular corner of this beautiful word that God has made for our enjoyment.",
