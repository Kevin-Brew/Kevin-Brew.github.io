    "blurb": "The sermon discusses the concept of being different, standing out in a crowd, and choosing to follow Christ. It emphasizes the importance of making conscious choices about our attitudes, behaviors, and life priorities. The sermon also explains the concept of 'metanoia', a Greek word used in the Bible, which means to repent, turn around, change direction, and take a different journey through life.",
    "raw_text": "Epiphany 1 \u2013 2017 \u2013 year A \u2013 Family Service\n\nWhy mention Preston North End Football Club? They are in the FA Cup 3rd Round \u2013 playing Arsenal. There can be some pretty scary supporters. In recent years they maybe haven\u2019t had much to cheer about. They were in the FA Cup Final \u2013 in 1954 against West Bromwich Albion, losing 3-2. There aren\u2019t many supporters this side of the water \u2013 I knew one in Belfast. In fact you could say that to be a supporter of Preston North End is to stand out as different from everyone else.\n\nThis morning I want to talk of ways of being different, of standing out in a crowd. Some people dress differently and do their hair differently. Then we are all different. God loves us all, no matter where we come from, how old we are \u2013 even how we dress.\n\nThe difference we are talking about this morning is who we follow. The lesson told of Baptism of Jesus \u2013 I want to think about our own Baptism. When we have a Baptism, at one point in the service I will say:\n\n>In baptism, God calls us from darkness into his marvellous light. To follow Christ means dying to sin and rising to new life with him.\n\nThat means very consciously choosing \u2013 choosing different attitudes, different behaviours, different priorities in life in the sort of people we choose to be.\n\nThe Bible talks about repentance \u2013 it uses a Greek word: 'metanoia'. That\u2019s what John and Jesus meant when they told people to 'repent'. Turn around, change direction, take a different journey through life.",
