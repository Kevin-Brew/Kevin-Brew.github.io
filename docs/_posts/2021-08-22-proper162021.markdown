blurb: "This sermon discusses the anxiety and fear that often come with life's challenges, likening it to a roller coaster ride. It highlights the experiences of biblical figures like Moses, Isaiah, and Jeremiah, who despite their fears, answered God's call. The sermon emphasizes the assurance that we are not alone in our struggles and that each of us has a unique value and purpose in God's plan."

I remember some years ago visiting a large theme park outside Paris that centred on the adventures of the French cartoon character Asterix. Asterix lived in a village in ancient Gaul (modern day France) during the time of the Roman Empire. At the centre of the theme park was something that went under the innocuous description of a “ride”. In the course of this ride, which lasted 1 minute and forty seconds, there were five loop the loops and a corkscrew.

It was clearly expected of father that he would accompany his offspring. Looking back on it, the worst part of this ride was the slow deliberate climb up to the top and then the car poised on the top before hurtling down into the rest of the ride. During that time, I sought comfort from the fact that the ride did only last 1 minute and 40 seconds and that no-one had been killed on it that day. The fear of what lay ahead was somewhat worse than the event itself.

Often we will hear of life being referred to as something of a roller coaster. I remember a show that later became a film ‘Stop the world – I want to get off’. Many of the key figures in the history of Israel might have said something similar in their moment of call. Moses for example, as he tended his father-in-law’s sheep in what was described as the ‘backside of the desert’, had that experience of God’s call on his life at the burning bush. Moses basically said to God, ‘Not me Lord; go and get someone else to do your work’. He suggested that Aaron was a much more powerful speaker. To which God replied, ‘Who made your mouth?’

Then of course there was Isaiah, with his own unique experience of God’s presence in the course of worship in the Temple – the only response he could make was, ‘Woe is me – for I am a man of unclean lips.’

They were both painfully aware of their frailty in the face of what God was calling them to do – an element of bracing themselves for the turmoil in their lives that they felt lay ahead – the anticipation of what lay ahead filled them with anxiety.

In our lesson this morning from the Book Jeremiah, we read of his experience of call and his own feelings of anxiety. For Moses, for Isaiah, for Jeremiah, the prospect of what lay ahead seemed daunting. But each of these individuals not only experienced God’s call but also God’s promise that whatever lay ahead will not have to be faced alone.

At the heart of the promise that we read about this morning is the assurance Jeremiah experiences as he contemplates what lies ahead – that he, Jeremiah, is valued as an individual before God.

‘Before I formed you in the womb I knew you.’

Jeremiah, you were no accident. You are special – I have a purpose for your life.

Waiting, the awareness that something is coming, something is going to happen, can be a source of great stress. It may be a matter of waiting for news of medical tests, waiting for a replay from someone, waiting, as is the case for many homes at this time of year, for news of exam results, results that will determine the future direction of young lives. As I often say in circumstances such as these 2 plus 2 can very quickly become 14 as anxiety takes over.

Those few days leading to the publication of exam results can be a bit like that slow climb up to the top of the roller coaster as folk brace themselves for what lies ahead. For some there is relief, for others the anxiety of disappointed hopes and the process of trying to find what is the best way forward.

I think one of the worst aspects of anxiety is the degree to which it robes us of any sense of control of our own destiny. To be in control is part and parcel of our own sense of being an individual – contributes to our own sense of our worth, our own value.

It is for good reason that the inmates of the Nazi concentration camps were stripped of anything that gave them identity – all possessions were removed, no longer referred to by name but simply by the number tattooed on their arm.

People recovering from serious illness would have often remarked to me how the experience sapped their self-confidence. They would speak of a feeling of circumstances drifting out of control, of being overtaken by events, of being powerless.

Waiting for results, waiting for medical tests, just waiting – all remind us of our own frailty. But over and against that I set the words that Jeremiah sensed that God was speaking to him as he sought to shrink back from what God was calling him to do. ‘Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you.’ God says to each one of us, ‘You are no accident.’ Each one of us carries that particular identity of ones made in the image of God; each one of us has that unique value as one for whom Christ died – each one of us has a value before God, a purpose before God that no-one, no circumstances, no disappointment can take away.

There is a prayer that I would have often used as a blessing over the years:

Go, and know that the Lord goes with you:
let him lead you each day into the quiet place of your heart, where he will speak with you;
know that he watches over you – that he listens to you in gentle understanding, that he is with you always, wherever you are and however you may feel:
May each of us go into this coming week and whatever lies ahead of us secure in the knowledge that each of us has a unique value as ones made in the image of God, that each of us is a focus of his love and concern – and in that find that peace that is his will for each one of us.
