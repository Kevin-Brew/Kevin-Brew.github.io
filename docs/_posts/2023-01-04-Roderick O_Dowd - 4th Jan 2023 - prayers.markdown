Funeral of Roderick O’Dowd – Prayers

I am persuaded that neither death, nor life,
nor angels, nor principalities,
nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation,
will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Romans 8: 38,39

We have come here today to remember before God our dear brother Roderick to
give thanks for his life, to leave him in the keeping of God his creator, redeemer
and judge, to commit his body to be buried, and to comfort one another in our
grief, in the hope that is ours through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Therefore we pray that here today we may know the peace of Christ in
communion with all God’s faithful servants.

God of all consolation,
whose Son Jesus Christ was moved to tears
at the grave of Lazarus his friend:
Look with compassion on us your children in our loss;
give to our troubled hearts the light of hope,
and strengthen in us the gift of faith,
in Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

Heavenly Father,
we thank you for Roderick
for the example he has left us,
and for the fellowship we have enjoyed with him.
We rejoice in your promise of eternal life
through Jesus Christ our Lord,
in whom the bond of love is never broken.

We pray for all who mourn, remembering Roderick’s wife Margaret, their children Roger,
Colin, Brian and Jane and their grandchildren.

God of all consolation,
whose Son Jesus Christ was moved to tears
at the grave of Lazarus his friend:
Look with compassion on us your children in our loss;
give to our troubled hearts the light of hope,
and strengthen in us the gift of faith,
in Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

Remembering Roderick’s love of nature:
Father, we thank you for the beauty and diversity of the created world we inhabit.
We ask for the wisdom to tend it carefully,
respecting the natural laws and sharing the resources,
listening to the weak as well as the strident,
the poor as well as the affluent and powerful,
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen

Bring us, o Lord God, at our last awakening into the house and gate of Heaven, to enter
into that gate and dwell in that house, where there shall be no darkness nor dazzling, but
one equal light; no noise nor silence, but one equal music; no fears or hopes, but one equal
possession; no ends or beginnings, but one equal eternity, in the habitations of thy glory
and dominion, world without end.

God our creator and redeemer,
by your power Christ conquered death and entered into glory.
Confident of his victory
and claiming his promises,
we now leave your servant Roderick in your gracious keeping;
in the name of Jesus our Lord,
who died and is alive
and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,
one God, now and for ever. Amen.

Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope
through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. 1 Peter 1: 3

The Lord is full of compassion and mercy,
slow to anger and of great kindness.
As a father cares for his children,
so does the Lord care for those who fear him.

For he himself knows of what we are made;
he remembers that we are but dust.
Our days are like the grass;
we flourish like a flower of the field.
When the wind goes over it, it is gone,
and its place shall know it no more.

But the merciful goodness of the Lord endures for ever
on those who fear him,
and his righteousness on children’s children.

Almighty God, our heavenly Father,
you have given us a sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life.
In your keeping are all those who have departed in Christ.
We here commit the body of our brother Roderick to the ground
earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust;
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who died, and was buried, and rose again for us,
and who shall change our mortal body
that it may be like his glorious body,
according to the mighty working
by which he is able to subdue all things to himself.

Thanks be to God who gives us the victory
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

The Lamb who is at the throne will be their shepherd, and will lead them to springs of
living water, and God will wipe away all tears from their eyes. Revelation 7: 17

God be in my head, and in my understanding.
God be in mine eyes, and in my looking.
God be in my mouth, and in my speaking.
God be in my heart, and in my thinking.
God be at mine end, and at my departing. Amen.
