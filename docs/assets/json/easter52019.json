    "blurb": "In this sermon, Kevin discusses the importance of embracing change and loving one another. He uses the story of Peter's vision and the inclusion of Gentiles into the Christian Church as an example of how change can lead to growth and inclusivity. He emphasizes that love, particularly Christ-like love, should be the guiding principle in our interactions with others.",
    "raw_text": "There is the story of a man who came upon two workmen. One man was carefully digging holes at regular intervals along the roadside. The second man followed along behind, carefully filling in the holes. When the second man was asked what he was doing, he said; \u2018Planting trees.\u2019 \u2018What do you mean? Where are the trees?\u2019 \u2018Well, you see, Ed here digs the holes; Chris puts in the trees; then I fill the holes. Unfortunately Chris is off sick.\u2019\n\nA story of people locked into a way of doing things that cannot be changes, however circumstances may change. It is easy to laugh at a story like that and lose sight of how we can fall into the same trap. Things have always been this way, why change?\n\nThis was certainly the attitude of one section of the Christian Church in Jerusalem when they heard what Peter had been up to in Caesarea, when he had gone into the house of a Gentile; had shared a meal with Gentiles and then had received those same Gentiles into the fellowship of the Church in Baptism. This had never been done before. Jews did not share fellowship with Gentiles. They certainly never shared meals with Gentiles \u2013 that food was unclean. As far as they were concerned, the Gospel was for those who were already Jews. That was the way it was, the way it always had been and always would be.\n\nBut things had changed. The ministry of Jesus of Nazareth, his death and resurrection had marked a new beginning in God\u2019s dealings with mankind. It marked the establishment of a new covenant that superseded the old covenant carved in tablets of stone.\n\nSo as Peter was to discover in his vision that he recounts in great detail, the old taboos of what he may or may not eat are set aside. \u2018What God has made clean, you must not call profane\u2019 In the summons to Caesarea he discovers that the old restrictions of who he may or may not have fellowship with are set aside. The commission of the risen Jesus to go into all the world, making disciples of all nations, is to be the dynamic of the new community.\n\nIt is a call to move out from the confines of what they have always done to embrace the challenge and opportunities of the death and resurrection of Jesus, to live as an Easter people. Had they not responded to that challenge, the Church would have remained as a sect within Judaism. God\u2019s purposes of redemption for all mankind, first enunciated in the promise to Abraham, that through him and his seed all nations would be blessed, would have been frustrated.\n\nOur Gospel reading tells of the message Jesus imparts to his disciples in the upper room on the night before he died; \u2018I give you a new commandment, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.\u2019 John 13:34-35\n\n\u2018Love one another\u2019. Not just a cosy feeling towards one another. No it is to go further than that, much further. \u2018Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another\u2019. Christian love, Christ-like love, the love that turns the other cheek. The love that goes the extra mile, the love that reaches out to the unworthy, the despised, those on the margins of society. It is a love that gives of itself; a redeeming love, a love that breaks down barriers of sin and death.\n\nThat is the love that we are to share with one another; a love that triumphs over discord, over failure.\n\n\u2018By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.\u2019 We do not witness to Christ by the stridency of our opinions, by assertions of our rights and prerogatives but by how we show in our common life the love that Christ has shown to us. Christ will be made known among us in ways in which we reach out to welcome those on the edge of our fellowship, ways in which we are prepared to forgive those who disappoint us, who hurt us.\n\nAll too often Christ\u2019s love for us is seen simply in terms of a prize to be gained. But we must move on to realise that having experienced the love of Christ we are to share it. We must not only say the words, we must live the prayer, \u2018Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.\u2019\n\nIndeed, unless we come to see God\u2019s love for us in Christ as something to be shared in word or deed, the we haven\u2019t really understood what it is all about.\n\nAs we welcome those who come to join us from outside, what will be their experience of us? May they come to see in us, in our fellowship with one another something of the self giving, self forgetting love of God in Christ and so be drawn into a deeper understanding of God\u2019s love for them in Christ.",

    "summary": "From the sermon provided, the top 4 concepts appear to be:\n\n1. **Adaptability and Innovation in Practice**: The story of the workmen illustrates the importance of adapting to changing circumstances rather than sticking to outdated practices.\n\n2. **Inclusivity and the Expansion of Fellowship**: Peter's experience with the Gentiles in Caesarea symbolizes the breaking down of traditional barriers and the extension of the church's fellowship to all people, regardless of their background.\n\n3. **Transformation through Christ's Teachings**: The sermon emphasizes the transformative power of Jesus' ministry, death, and resurrection, leading to a new covenant and a call to live as an \"Easter people.\"\n\n4. **The Essence of Christian Love**: The sermon highlights the new commandment to love one another as Jesus loved, which involves self-giving, barrier-breaking, and reaching out to the marginalized.\n\nFor a non-religious black and white pencil diagram that can be graphically represented, the concept of **Adaptability and Innovation in Practice** seems most suitable, as it can be illustrated without specific religious symbols and is a universally applicable idea.\n\nHere is a detailed prompt for DALL-E 3 to create an image for the concept of Adaptability and Innovation in Practice:\n\n\"Create a black and white pencil drawing that depicts a series of gears and cogs connected in a complex machine.
