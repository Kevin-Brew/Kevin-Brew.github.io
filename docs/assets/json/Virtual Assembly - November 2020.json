    "blurb": "Kevin addresses the Burrow School community in a virtual assembly, acknowledging the challenges faced during the pandemic and the things they've missed out on. He expresses his anticipation for the new classrooms to replace the prefabs next year. Despite the changes to the usual Christmas celebrations, he reminds everyone of the true meaning of Christmas and encourages them to enjoy the lead up to the holiday.",
    "raw_text": "First of all I want to say a huge thank you to everyone in the Burrow School for the many ways you have handled yourselves this term in the face of the virus - a huge thank you to Miss Lynn and the teaching staff; to all students. This has not been an easy time for any of you \u2013 people have been anxious, not sure how it would all work out. But you\u2019ve done it, thanks to everyone\u2019s collective efforts, you have kept the Burrow safe.\n\nOf course in the process we\u2019ve all missed out on a number of things. I for one have really missed the assemblies each Friday. It always amazed me \u2013 each assembly was different, each assembly was special, each assembly gave me something to think about. In fact, many a time I quoted something that was said in assembly the following Sunday.\n\nWe\u2019re missing out on the Burrow Christmas Fair. Quite apart from the money that you raise (which goes towards things in the School), over the years these fairs have been lovely community occasions. I\u2019ve always loved seeing people who used to be at the Burrow coming back to visit to talk to old friends, to talk to teachers.\n\nSo we are missing out on Assemblies, we\u2019re missing out on the Christmas Fair \u2013 but isn\u2019t it great news that our long awaited permanent classrooms to replace the prefabs will be staring to appear sometime next year. So this time next year, there will be lovely new modern classrooms.\n\nNow of course, we are getting ready for Christmas and all the excitement that goes with that. People are wondering what presents to get, what presents they hope to get. Christmas meals are being planned, Christmas cards are being sent. But as with so many other things this year \u2013 Christmas will be different to other years. We\u2019re only allowed to have 50 people in St Mary\u2019s so we won\u2019t be able to have that huge family service in Church on Christmas morning. We won\u2019t be able to have the Burrow School end of year service in St Mary\u2019s \u2013 that has always been a very special service for me as in reading and drama and songs you tell the Christmas story.\n\nBut that reminds me that the important things will remain the same. We will remember the birth of the one who lies behind all our celebrations. We will remember Joseph and Mary travelling to Bethlehem. Not to stay in some swanky hotel \u2013 the only place they could find was a stable. There Mary will give birth to her beautiful baby on the first Christmas Day.\n\nSo, enjoy all the fun of the lead up to Christmas \u2013 choosing presents, making special food and decorations. But listen - listen as your teachers tell you the story of that first Christmas Day, how Jesus came to bring life and hope and joy to us all.",
