    "blurb": "The sermon focuses on the concept of Love as a fruit of the Spirit. It emphasizes the self-giving, self-sacrificing nature of Christian love, drawing parallels with God's unfailing mercy. The ultimate expression of love is seen in Jesus' sacrifice on the cross. The sermon encourages believers to show a healing, reconciling, and redeeming love in their lives, just like Jesus.",
    "raw_text": "On Ash Wednesday we began thinking about the whole issue of change that we might want to see in ourselves. Desire to change arises out of a sense of dissatisfaction with ourselves \u2013 overweight - we go on a diet. Out of condition \u2013 we go on a fitness routine. Discipline only part of Lent \u2013 also a penitential season \u2013 designed to encourage us to think about repentance.\n\nRepentance is a change in direction \u2013 so alongside the discipline, the giving up, the laying aside \u2013 there is also a process of building up. We expect to see results. The diet, the fitness routine \u2013 we look for signs that this is working \u2013 we look for fruits of our discipline.\n\nPaul uses the word fruits in his letter to the Galatians when he speaks of fruits of the Spirit. I set that alongside the teaching of the Revised Catechism: Holy Spirit enables me to become more like Jesus. So we look for these fruits of the Spirit as they are to be found in Jesus and in God himself.\n\nTonight focus on LOVE. English language has only one word that covers the whole range of love from the physical, the friendship, the self giving, spiritual aspects of love. Christian love, be it the spiritual or indeed the physical or the friendship must always have within it the self giving, self sacrificing love of God.\n\nLove is a word that occurs right through the Bible. In the Old Testament , one of the most common of usages is that of \u2018the unfailing mercy of God\u2019.\n\nScriptures described as God\u2019s love letter to mankind \u2013 a story of love that continues in the face of all setbacks. Man turns his back of god but God will not, cannot turn his back on man.\n\nUltimate expression of love is Jesus on the Cross. It is what I like to call Calvary love \u2013 love at full stretch \u2013 image of child asking how much we love them \u2013 do you love me this much. God in Christ is saying I love you this much \u2013 arms stretched out, nailed to the Cross \u2013 love at full stretch.\n\nThis is the starting point for my response of love. This is where the teaching of the work of the Holy Spirit comes in. Holy Spirit enables me to become more like Jesus. Jesus love is a healing, reconciling, redeeming love - our lives should show the same.\n\nLove relational - not conditional or manipulative \u2013 if you loved me etc \u2026\u2026 Love in Jesus very opposite of conditional \u2013 makes the first step. \u2018While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us\u2019. His love precedes my repentance, my response. God has done his part \u2013 now up to me to respond.\n\nI am called to be an initiator in reconciliation, in forgiveness \u2013 how can we begin to make this happen? Love that knows no boundaries \u2013 love not just our neighbour but also our enemy \u2013 example of Gordon Wilson.\n\nLove that does not count the cost - cost of the cross in words \u2018 My God, my God! Why have you forsaken me?\u2019 In the extent of God\u2019s love, love at full stretch I recognise the poverty of my response. Not a simple imitation, something done in my own strength and my own will power. Letting Jesus live in and through me.\n\nAs Paul wrote to the Galatians: I have been crucified with Christ; 20 and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. Holy Spirit enables me to become more like Jesus. What are the obstacles to God\u2019s love?",
