Do you remember? Your first day at school? Your first teacher? Do you remember - the first time you rode a bicycle, the day you learned to swim? Do you remember your first day at work? Do you remember your wedding day? Do you remember your Baptism? - we are remembering who we belong to.

Next Sunday 8 of our young people are being confirmed. Do you remember your own confirmation? The day of taking for ourselves the promises of Baptism Bishop of Aston – St Lawrence’s Northfield. ‘You did not choose me, I chose you and appointed you.’

2nd half of our Gospel reading – ‘In the same way that you gave me a mission in the world, I give them a mission in the world.’ As we were thinking through the commandments the other night we ended up with thinking of what it meant to be a follower of Christ

> Christ has no body but yours,
> No hands, no feet on earth but yours,
> Yours are the eyes with which he looks
> Compassion on this world,
> Yours are the feet with which he walks to do good,
> Yours are the hands, with which he blesses all the world.
> Yours are the hands, yours are the feet,
> Yours are the eyes, you are his body.
> Christ has no body now but yours,
> No hands, no feet on earth but yours,
> Yours are the eyes with which he looks
> compassion on this world.
> Christ has no body now on earth but yours.

That is our mission in the world – to be the hands, the feet, the eyes of Christ – wherever you choose to live, in whatever family you establish for yourself, in whatever work you choose to do.
