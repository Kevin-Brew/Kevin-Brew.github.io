He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.\"\n\n**JOHN 14:6**\n6 Jesus said to him, \"I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.\"\n\n**JOHN 16:13**\nWhen the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own, but will speak whatever he hears, and he will declare to you the things that are to come.\n\n**JOHN 17:17-19**\n17 Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth. 18 As you have sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world. 19 And for their sakes I sanctify myself, so that they also may be sanctified in truth.\n\n**JOHN 18:37-38**\n37 Pilate asked him, \"So you are a king?\" Jesus answered, \"You say that I am a king. For this I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.\" 38 Pilate asked him, \"What is truth?\"\n\n**1 JOHN 1:8; 2:4; 3:18-19; 5:6**\n8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\n4 Whoever says, \"I have come to know him,\" but does not obey his commandments, is a liar, and in such a person the truth does not exist;\n18 Little children, let us love, not in word or speech, but in truth and action. 19 And by this we will know that we are from the truth and will reassure our hearts before him.\n\n**2 JOHN 1:1-4**\n1 The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not only I but also all who know the truth, 2 because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever: 3 Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father's Son, in truth and love.\n\n**3 JOHN 1:1-4**\nThe elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth. 2 Beloved, I pray that all may go well with you and that you may be in good health, just as it is well with your soul. 3 I was overjoyed when some of the friends arrived and testified to your faithfulness to the truth, namely how you walk in the truth. 4 I have no greater joy than this, to hear that my children are walking in the truth.\n\n**ROMANS 2:8; 3:7**\n8 while for those who are self-seeking and who obey not the truth but wickedness, there will be wrath and fury.\n7 But if through my falsehood God's truthfulness abounds to his glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner?\n\n**1 CORINTHIANS 13:6**\n6 it does not rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices in the truth.\n\n**2 CORINTHIANS 7:14; 11:10**\n14 For if I have been somewhat boastful about you to him, I was not disgraced; but just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting to Titus has proved true as well.\n10 As the truth of Christ is in me, this boast of mine will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia.\n\n**GALATIANS 2:5; 5:7**\n5 we did not submit to them even for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might always remain with you.\n7 You were running well; who prevented you from obeying the truth?\n\n**EPHESIANS 4:21; 5:9; 6:14**\n21 For surely you have heard about him and were taught in him, as truth is in Jesus.\n9 for the fruit of the light is found in all that is good and right and true.\n14 Stand therefore, and fasten the belt of truth around your waist, and put on the breastplate of righteousness.\n\n**PHILIPPIANS 1:18**\n18 What does it matter? Just this, that Christ is proclaimed in every way, whether out of false motives or true; and in that I rejoice.\n\n**COLOSSIANS 1:6**\nthat has come to you. Just as it is bearing fruit and growing in the whole world, so it has been bearing fruit among yourselves from the day you heard it and truly comprehended the grace of God.\n\n**2 THESSALONIANS 2:12**\n12 so that all who have not believed the truth but took pleasure in unrighteousness will be condemned.\n\n**1 TIMOTHY 2:7**\n7 For this I was appointed a herald and an apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.\n\n**2 TIMOTHY 3:8**\n8 As Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these people, of corrupt mind and counterfeit faith, also oppose the truth.\n\n**2 PETER 1:12**\n12 Therefore I intend to keep on reminding you of these things, though you know them already and are established in the truth that has come to you.",
