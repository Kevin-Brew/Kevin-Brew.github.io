    "blurb": "This sermon was delivered at the funeral of Mrs. Orla Ennis, a woman known for her resilience and love for life. Despite her illness, she continued to live a full life, caring for her family and animals. The sermon invites the attendees to remember Orla's life and the ways she enriched theirs. It also offers comfort and hope in the face of death, drawing on Christian faith.",
    "raw_text": "I remember going to see Orla shortly after she got news of her diagnosis that the cancer was back. She was getting me a cup of tea in the kitchen in 'Green Ivies' while she cleared a cat off the counter and gave off to a dog. She paused and looked straight at me and said, 'Well I can either fight this or go and jump off the nearest cliff.' Fighting for Orla meant living a normal life, not allowing the illness (which she knew full well was serious) to totally dominate her life.\n\nToday family and friends gather here in St Mary\u2019s Church for her funeral. Funerals are occasions of sadness for they mark the loss of one we have loved, who has loved us. Their parting leaves a gap in our lives that no-one else can fill in quite the same way. They are also occasions to celebrate the life, the love, the energy of the one who has died.\n\nIn time she met Francis Ennis. They married and set up home and reared their five daughters, Stephanie, Sarah, Suzanne, Niamh and Nicola. The family was at the heart of her life. She might scold, she might give off but she was always there to help, to encourage, fiercely proud of all they achieved. There is no doubt she will be sorely missed.\n\nWe come to set the mystery of death in the context of our Christian faith. Here in Church we celebrate the great festivals that celebrate the great events of our faith, the goodness of God, the love of God. And here we mark the great events of life; we celebrate births, the love that leads on to marriage; here we seek strength and comfort in the face of the uncertainties of life, of illness and death.\n\nWhat we are declaring today is that darkness has not had the last word in the life of Orla Ennis. Sickness, weakness has not had the final say. Her body may be spent but Orla lives on. In fellowship with the Apostle John, we follow a Lord who knows what death, what suffering, what loss is all about; one who knew what it was like to weep at the grave of his friend Lazarus. Not only that, he is the one who was raised triumphant over death, breaking the power of death itself.\n\nHaving grown up in Howth, with a love of sailing and of the sea, I find this poem a lovely expression for our hope for Orla and for ourselves expressed in the sailing traditions of this place.\n\nA Parable of Immortality.\nI am standing by the seashore.\nA ship at my side spreads her white sails to the morning breeze and starts for the blue ocean.\nShe is an object of beauty and strength, and I stand and watch until at last she hangs like a speck of white cloud just where the sun and sky come down to mingle with each other.\nThen someone at my side says, 'There she goes! '\nGone where? Gone from my sight - that is all.\nShe is just as large in mast and hull and spar as she was when she left my side and just as able to bear her load of living freight to the places of destination.\nHer diminished size is in me, not in her.\nAnd just at the moment when someone at my side says, 'There she goes!', there are other eyes watching her coming, and other voices ready to take up the glad shout :\n'Here she comes!'",

She was getting me a cup of tea in the kitchen in \u2018Green\nIvies\u2019 while she cleared a cat off the counter and gave off to a dog. She paused\nand looked straight at me and said, \u2018Well I can either fight this or go and jump\noff the nearest cliff.\u2019 Fighting for Orla meant living a normal life, not allowing\nthe illness (which she knew full well was serious) to totally dominate her life.\nOK there were the hospital visits, the treatments that made her feel lousy and I\nhave no doubt there were her dark times \u2013 but there was still a house to run,\nhorses, dogs, cats, chickens, parrots, pigs and goodness knows what else to\nlook after, a family to organise, friends and family to enjoy. All who have\nknown her during this time will speak of her no-nonsense, can-do, will-do\napproach to life.\nToday family and friends gather here in St Mary\u2019s Church for her funeral.\nFunerals are occasions of sadness for they mark the loss of one we have loved,\nwho has loved us. Their parting leaves a gap in our lives that no-one else can\nfill in quite the same way. They are also occasions to celebrate the life, the\nlove, the energy of the one who has died. What are your memories of Orla\nEnnis \u2013 as wife, as mother, as sister, as friend? In the course of this service I\nwould invite you to come before God with your own particular memories of\nOrla and give thanks to God for the various ways in which she has enriched our\nlives. Her family has its roots in this place, she was very much a native of\nHowth. Her father had died while she was still young. She and her brother Ian\nwere brought up by their mother Muriel and Aunt Rene who are both still\nremembered with great affection in this Parish.\nPage 2 of 4\nFuneral of Mrs Orla Ennis\nHowth \u2013 11th August 201\nIn time she met Francis Ennis. They married and set up home and reared their\nfive daughters, Stephanie, Sarah, Suzanne, Niamh and Nicola. The family was\nat the heart of her life. She might scold, she might give off but she was always\nthere to help, to encourage, fiercely proud of all they achieved. There is no\ndoubt she will be sorely missed. Throughout her illness she has shown\nremarkable courage and resilience. Over the last couple of months she was\nsurrounded and upheld by the love of the family. In this regard Stephanie has\nasked me to express on behalf of the family in Green Ivies their gratitude to\nOrla\u2019s sister-in-law Judith for her very practical love and friendship to Orla\nover these difficult times.\nThose of us outside the immediate family circle, friends and colleagues from\nbusiness, from sailing, from the world of horses, from the wider community\nhave come today to offer our love and support to Francis, to Stephanie, Sarah,\nSuzanne, Niamh and Nicola, to Ian, to Judith and all those who loved this very\nordinary yet extraordinary person, to assure you all of our love and prayers not\njust today but in the weeks and months to come as you build a new and\ndifferent life for yourselves without Orla.\nWe come to set the mystery of death in the context of our Christian faith. Here\nin Church we celebrate the great festivals that celebrate the great events of our\nfaith, the goodness of God, the love of God. And here we mark the great\nevents of life; we celebrate births, the love that leads on to marriage; here we\nseek strength and comfort in the face of the uncertainties of life, of illness and\nPage 3 of 4\nFuneral of Mrs Orla Ennis\nHowth \u2013 11th August 201\ndeath. Orla would have laid no claim to regular attendance but this place was\nstill her spiritual home and Christmas was one of those occasions that Orla\nloved. At Christmas we hear those lovely words from St John\u2019s Gospel:-\n4What has come into being in him was life, and the life was\nthe light of all people. 5The light shines in the darkness, and\nthe darkness did not overcome it.\n12But to all who received him, who believed in his name, he\ngave power to become children of God, 13who were born, not\nof blood or of the will of the flesh or of the will of man, but of\nGod.\n5The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome\nit.\nWhat we are declaring today is that darkness has not had the last word in the\nlife of Orla Ennis. Sickness, weakness has not had the final say. Her body\nmay be spent but Orla lives on. In fellowship with the Apostle John, we follow\na Lord who knows what death, what suffering, what loss is all about; one who\nknew what it was like to weep at the grave of his friend Lazarus. Not only that,\nhe is the one who was raised triumphant over death, breaking the power of\ndeath itself. Knowing in his own person what it was all about, I find in him\none to whom I cam come in my own time of suffering and find real comfort,\nreal strength and real hope.\nHaving grown up in Howth, with a love of sailing and of the sea, I find this\npoem a lovely expression for our hope for Orla and for ourselves expressed in\nthe sailing traditions of this place.\nA Parable of Immortality.\nI am standing by the seashore.\nPage 4 of 4\nFuneral of Mrs Orla Ennis\nHowth \u2013 11th August 201\nA ship at my side spreads her white sails to the morning breeze\nand starts for the blue ocean.\nShe is an object of beauty and strength,\nand I stand and watch\nuntil at last she hangs like a speck of white cloud\njust where the sun and sky come down to mingle with each other.\nThen someone at my side says, \u2018There she goes! \u2018\nGone where?
