EASTER GENERAL VESTRY – 2019

This time last year, as we gathered for our Easter General Vestry, we had recently completed the work on the roof of St Mary’s and associated works. We were quite justifiably feeling good about ourselves, with a very positive outcome from our fundraising efforts, and we were back in the Church. Kevin emphasized the need to focus on the future and what lies ahead for us as a Church and as a society.

Before we embarked on the work on the roof, there was a detailed examination of the structure and a scheme of works drawn up. Resources were identified, and decisions were made to ensure the project's successful conclusion. Kevin often reminds us, 'Fixing the roof has been the easy bit. What goes on under the roof is going to be a harder problem.' As we prepare to tackle that problem, we need an honest appraisal of the issues facing us in the coming years both as a Church and as a society.

Kevin points out the changing demographics in the parish, with declining attendance at services and the challenges of maintaining Sunday School. He also notes the societal changes in Ireland, with referenda on marriage equality and abortion signaling massive shifts. The last Census showed that 48% of those aged 25-29 in the Dublin Metropolitan area have no religious affiliation.

The Parish of Howth is on the brink of a significant population increase, with large apartment developments planned. Kevin asks if the community that comes to Churches seeking meaning will find a welcoming community that embraces their differences. He quotes, 'The times they are a changing,' and asks what resources we bring to these identified issues.

Kevin speaks of the faith that God has a purpose for this place and the need to discern God's purposes afresh in every generation. He acknowledges the contributions of the parishioners, the youth, and the building itself, which has stood since 1866. He recounts the history of the church and the adaptability of the community to serve the needs of the time.

The Select Vestry has decided to merge two separate Sunday services into one at 10:30, continuing past the end of August until December, when the situation will be reviewed. This change aims to respond to varying worship needs and the new population settling in the area.

Kevin concludes by thanking various members of the Parish for their service and contributions over the past year. He expresses gratitude to those who have served as Church Wardens, the Select Vestry, the Treasurer, and those involved in music, youth work, the Parish Newsletter, the Fete, and various community groups. He acknowledges the challenges ahead but remains hopeful, stating that the future of the Parish will be different because the world we are moving into is very different, and the Church must speak to that world.
