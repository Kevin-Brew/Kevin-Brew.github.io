    "blurb": "This sermon, delivered on Christmas Day 2018, explores the concept of Incarnation and the birth of Jesus Christ. Using a simple story about a man who didn't believe in the 'Jesus Story', the sermon illustrates the idea of God coming to Earth as a man. The man's experience with a flock of birds during a snowstorm helps him understand the concept of Incarnation.",
    "raw_text": "Today is Christmas Day. Today we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ, Son of God, God coming among us. Adults, theologians, clergy use big words like Incarnation. Hymn writers use words like 'consubstantial, co-eternal, three in one and one in three' \u2013 and we can tie ourselves in knots trying to get our heads around it. Sometimes a simple story puts it better.\n\nNow the man to whom I'm going to introduce you was not a scrooge, he was a kind, decent, mostly good man. Generous to his family, upright in his dealings with other men. But he just didn't believe all that incarnation stuff which the churches proclaim at Christmas Time. It just didn't make sense and he was too honest to pretend otherwise. He just couldn't swallow the Jesus Story, about God coming to Earth as a man. \"I'm truly sorry to distress you,\" he told his wife, \"but I'm not going with you to church this Christmas Eve.\" He said he'd feel like a hypocrite. That he'd much rather just stay at home, but that he would wait up for them. And so he stayed and they went to the midnight service.\n\nShortly after the family drove away in the car, snow began to fall. He went to the window to watch the flurries getting heavier and heavier and then went back to his fireside chair and began to read his newspaper. Minutes later he was startled by a thudding sound. Then another, and then another. Sort of a thump or a thud. At first he thought someone must be throwing snowballs against his living room window. But when he went to the front door to investigate he found a flock of birds huddled miserably in the snow. They'd been caught in the storm and, in a desperate search for shelter, had tried to fly through his large landscape window.\n\nWell, he couldn't let the poor creatures lie there and freeze, so he remembered the barn where his children stabled their pony. That would provide a warm shelter, if he could direct the birds to it. Quickly he put on a coat, galoshes, tramped through the deepening snow to the barn. He opened the doors wide and turned on a light, but the birds did not come in. He figured food would entice them in. So he hurried back to the house, fetched bread crumbs, sprinkled them on the snow, making a trail to the yellow-lighted wide open doorway of the stable. But to his dismay, the birds ignored the bread crumbs, and continued to flap around helplessly in the snow. He tried catching them. He tried shooing them into the barn by walking around them waving his arms. Instead, they scattered in every direction, except into the warm, lighted barn.\n\nAnd then, he realized, that they were afraid of him. To them, he reasoned, I am a strange and terrifying creature. If only I could think of some way to let them know that they can trust me. That I am not trying to hurt them, but to help them. But how? Because any move he made tended to frighten them, confuse them. They just would not follow. They would not be led or shooed because they feared him. \"If only I could be a bird,\" he thought to himself, \"and mingle with them and speak their language. Then I could tell them not to be afraid. Then I could show them the way to safe, warm . . . to the safe warm barn. But I would have to be one of them so they could see, and hear and understand.\"\n\nAt that moment the church bells began to ring. The sound reached his ears above the sounds of the wind. And he stood there listening to the bells--\"Adeste Fidelis\"--listening to the bells pealing the glad tidings of Christmas. And it suddenly made sense.\n\nAnd the word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth.",

    "prompt": "Create a black and white pencil sketch that illustrates the theme of compassion and assistance in a non-religious context. The scene should depict a snowy winter landscape at night, with a man standing by an open barn door that is emitting a warm light. In the foreground, a flock of birds is huddled in the snow, looking cold and vulnerable. The man has a gentle expression on his face and is scattering bread crumbs from his hand, creating a trail leading to the barn. His other hand is extended toward the birds in a welcoming gesture, but not touching them, showing his respect for their space and his understanding of their fear. The barn is simple and does not have any religious symbols on it. The sky is clear, and the snow is gently falling, adding to the serene and quiet atmosphere of the scene. The focus is on the man's compassionate action and the birds' hesitant response, capturing a moment of attempted connection and care between human and nature.",
    "summary": "From the sermon provided, here are the top four concepts:\n\n1. Incarnation: The theological concept of God becoming flesh in the person of Jesus Christ.\n2. Belief and Skepticism: The internal conflict between belief in religious teachings and personal skepticism, as illustrated by the story of the man who couldn't accept the incarnation.\n3. Compassion and Assistance: The man's desire to help the birds find shelter, showing his innate kindness and concern for other creatures.\n4. Understanding and Communication: The realization that to truly help and communicate with the birds, one must be like them, which parallels the idea of God becoming man to communicate with humanity.\n\nFor a non-religious black and white pencil diagram that can be graphically represented, the concept of \"Compassion and Assistance\" seems most suitable, as it can be depicted without religious symbols and is a universal theme.\n\nHere is a detailed prompt for DALL-E 3 to create an image for the concept of \"Compassion and Assistance\":\n\n\"Create a black and white pencil sketch that illustrates the theme of compassion and assistance in a non-religious context.
