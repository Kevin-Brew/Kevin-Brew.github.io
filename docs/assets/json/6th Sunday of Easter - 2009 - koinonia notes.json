    "prompt": "Create a black and white pencil sketch that depicts the concept of charitable help. The image should portray a series of vignettes that show people of diverse backgrounds engaging in acts of kindness and support. In one vignette, illustrate a person giving a warm coat to a homeless individual on a chilly day. In another, show a person comforting someone who is visibly upset, offering a compassionate hug. Another vignette should depict a volunteer handing out food at a soup kitchen, with a focus on the exchange of the meal from one person to another. The final scene should show a person helping an elderly individual cross a busy street, guiding them safely to the other side. The overall composition should convey a sense of community, empathy, and the human connection that comes from selfless acts of assistance. No religious symbols, text, or explicit references to any faith should be included, ensuring the image represents the universal value of helping others.",
    "summary": "Based on the sermon text provided, here are the top 4 concepts extracted:\n\n1. Fellowship - The concept of community and sharing a common faith, as mentioned in 1 John 1:3.\n2. Worship - Acts of devotion and reverence, including teachings, prayer, and communal activities as described in Acts 2:42.\n3. Eucharist (Participation) - The symbolic act of communion, representing unity with the divine through the sharing of bread and wine, as referenced in 1 Corinthians 10:16.\n4. Charitable Help (Outworking in Life) - The expression of faith through acts of kindness and sharing with others, as encouraged in Hebrews 13:16.\n\nFrom these concepts, \"Charitable Help\" seems the most suitable for a non-religious black and white pencil diagram that avoids any religious symbols or text. It can be represented in a way that focuses on the universal value of helping others without specific religious connotations.\n\nHere is a detailed prompt for DALL-E 3 to create an image for the concept of Charitable Help:\n\n\"Create a black and white pencil sketch that depicts the concept of charitable help.
