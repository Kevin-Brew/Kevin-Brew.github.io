USE OF THE WORD ‘KING’ IN JOHN’S Gospel

Jn 1:49.

49 Nathanael replied, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!"

Jn 6:15.

When Jesus realized that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, he withdrew again to the mountain by himself.

Jn 12:13-15.

So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, shouting,

"Hosanna!
Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord--
the King of Israel!"

Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it; as it is written:

"Do not be afraid, daughter of Zion.
Look, your king is coming,
sitting on a donkey's colt!"

Jn 18:33.

Then Pilate entered the headquarters again, summoned Jesus, and asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"

Jesus answered, "My kingdom is not from this world. If my kingdom were from this world, my followers would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jews. But as it is, my kingdom is not from here." 37 Pilate asked him, "So you are a king?" Jesus answered, "You say that I am a king. For this I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice."

Jn 18:39

But you have a custom that I release someone for you at the Passover. Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?"

Jn 19:3

They kept coming up to him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!" and striking him on the face.

Jn 19:12

From then on Pilate tried to release him, but the Jews cried out, "If you release this man, you are no friend of the emperor. Everyone who claims to be a king sets himself against the emperor."

Jn 19:14

Now it was the day of Preparation for the Passover; and it was about noon. He said to the Jews, "Here is your King!" 15 They cried out, "Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!" Pilate asked them, "Shall I crucify your King?" The chief priests answered, "We have no king but the emperor." 16 Then he handed him over to them to be crucified.

Jn 19:19-21

Pilate also had an inscription written and put on the cross. It read, "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews." 20 Many of the Jews read this inscription, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek. 21 Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, "Do not write, 'The King of the Jews,' but, 'This man said, I am King of the Jews.'
