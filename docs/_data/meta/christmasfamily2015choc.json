    "blurb": "This sermon tells the story of Christmas in a unique and engaging way, using different types of chocolates as metaphors. It emphasizes the message that God sent His Son into the world to be our Saviour, to set us free from the things that hold us back from being what he wants us to be. It reminds us that God's gift of His Son is for everyone, and that the Christmas story is cause for celebration.",
    "raw_text": "Christmas Day 2015 \u2013 Family Service \u2013 a chocolate Christmas\n\nTHE CHRISTMAS STORY\n\nMany years ago, a girl called Mary heard a WISPA from an angel who told her that she would be the Mother of God\u2019s son. Mary was both amazed and afraid. How could this be? To have a baby now would be a TOPIC of conversation in the village.\n\nWhen Joseph heard about this he thought to himself, \u2018I don\u2019t want to expose Mary to public disgrace. I will send her away quietly\u2019 But then, an angel appeared to Joseph in a DREAM and said, \u2018Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will bear a son and you are to name him Jesus for he will save his people from their sins\u2019 Joseph did as the angel of the Lord commanded him; he took Mary as his wife.\n\nBefore Jesus was born,a census was to be taken. Joseph and Mary left Nazareth and travelled to Bethlehem. It was a very long journey, and of course there were no AEROplanes in those days so they couldn\u2019t take a flight and there were no cars or TAXIS so they couldn\u2019t get a lift so they had to walk all the way.\n\nWhen they arrived in Bethlehem, Joseph tried to find somewhere for himself and Mary to stay but everywhere was full. Eventually they were offered a stable and it was there that the little baby was born. He was named Jesus.\n\nThat night, some shepherds, heard a noise from above. Whey they looked up they saw a multitude of angels praising God and saying \u2018Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace among those whom he favours!\u2019\n\nWhen the shepherds heard the good news of the birth of Jesus, they decided to take a break (KIT KAT) from looking after their sheep. \u2018Let\u2019s go and see what is happening in Bethlehem\u2019. They travelled to Bethlehem and there they found, in a stable, Joseph, Mary and the baby Jesus, who was lying in a manger. The shepherds REVELled at the thought that this child was so special. \u2018Could this be just as the prophets had foretold? Is this the LION of Judah?\u2019\n\nIt was getting late, AFTER EIGHT in fact, so the shepherds returned to the hills and to their sheep. Meanwhile, in a far country, some wise men, some SMARTIES, were busily scanning the GALAXY when they saw a star near the MILKY WAY. \u2018Is that MARS?\u2019 \u2018No, that is a special STAR signalling the birth of a King.\n\nThe wise men set off travelling and eventually reached Herod\u2019s Palace \u2013 they were not embarrassed to HOBNOB with royalty. \u2018Where is the child who has been born King of the Jews? For we observed his star at its rising and have come to pay him homage\u2019 When Herod heard this he was very interested \u2018A King has been born?\u2019 At first he didn\u2019t believe them and called the M ALL TEASERS. But he had to make sure and so he tried to FUDGE the issue.\n\nThe wise men travelled until they found Jesus and they offered their BOUNTY, Gold, Frankincense and Myrrh. Then God warned them in a dream that Herod was up to his old TWIX What he really wanted to do was kill the baby Jesus. So the wise men took TIME OUT to return by another route.\n\nAnd so we have the chocolate version of the Christmas story. But whatever way this story is told the message is still the same. That God sent His Son into the world to be our Saviour, to set us free from the things that hold us back from being what he wants us to be. In Jesus Christ we have someone who believes in us and who wants us to make a difference for Him in the world around us. And God has promised that Jesus His Son will always be with us not just now during this Christmas season. No matter where we are or what we are doing, He is there helping us to become the people He wants us to be. God\u2019s gift of His Son is for everyone, all we have to do is to be open to receive Him into our hearts and into our lives. And that is good news for all of us here this Christmas morning. The Christmas story really is cause for CELEBRATION, Jesus is no MINATURE HERO!",
