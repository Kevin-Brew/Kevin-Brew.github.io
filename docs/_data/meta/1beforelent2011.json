    "blurb": "This sermon reflects on the story of the Transfiguration of our Lord and the disciples' journey with Jesus. It emphasizes the importance of not just admiring Jesus, but obeying and following him. The sermon also discusses the disciples' struggle to understand who Jesus was and assures that Jesus is with us in our struggles and searches.",
    "raw_text": "One of the TV series I remember when I was growing up was the BBC programme 'Steptoe and Son'. It is the story of a father and son working in a rather haphazard partnership as Rag and bone men \u2013 the forerunners of the recycling business. The son Harold feels trapped and yearns to move on and yet cannot bring himself to leave \u2013 the old man for his part cannot understand his discontent. He looks back to the old days, repeating stories of his time in the trenches of the 1st World War. Harold knows the stories so well he can repeat them word for word \u2013 knows them so well he has stopped listening.\n\nWe read as our Gospel reading the story of the Transfiguration of our Lord before his disciples \u2013 as with so many of the Gospel stories it can become so familiar that we all too easily stop listening as it is read to us. As we stop listening, we stop reflecting, so we stop learning.\n\nThis is one of the few incidents in the Gospels apart from the passion that is referred to in the Epistles, the 2nd letter of Peter. This incident comes at a crucial point in the Gospel story and the disciples\u2019 fellowship with Jesus. Up to this time, apart from some opposition from religious leaders, he had by and large been well received. From this point on Jesus sets his face towards Jerusalem and his coming suffering and death.\n\nFrom the very outset the disciples had had some remarkable experiences of Jesus \u2013 there had been his baptism in the river Jordan by John and with it the voice from heaven; there had been the stilling of the storm; they had been present as he had taught and healed. They knew he was different and yet they did not know why. Prior to this we read of Peter\u2019s confession of Jesus as the Christ \u2013 but when Jesus goes on to talk of his coming suffering and death, Peter cannot bear to think of it \u2013 'No Lord, this will never happen to you!' \u2013 only to suffer the chilling rebuke, 'Get you behind me, Satan!'\n\nAs the Gospel story unfolds, we read of a deepening crisis for the disciples as they watch their master, in whom they had put such hope, for whom they had abandoned their families and security, set his face towards Jerusalem and his coming suffering and death. At this crucial point in the story the disciples are, in the events described in our Gospel reading, given a number of assurances concerning Jesus \u2013 though in truth they are only to recognise them after the events of Good Friday and Easter.\n\nIn the vision of Jesus talking with Moses and Elijah, the Gospel writer sets Jesus\u2019 ministry in the wider context of the whole salvation history \u2013 God giving the law through Moses, God calling his people through the prophets. The words from heaven recall the experiences of Jesus\u2019 baptism: 'This is my son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased; listen to him!' Jesus is there not just to be admired \u2013 he is there to be obeyed and to be followed.\n\nThe disciples journey on with Jesus. In our day we continue to read the Gospel story, in the context of the Mount of Transfiguration. This is not the story of one more failed Messiah, this is Gospel truth - this is God acting, speaking, living, dying in the person of Jesus. As we watch, he asks the same question of us that he asked of disciples of old \u2013 'Who do you say that I am?'\n\nThere is a further aspect to this story and the events surrounding it that I want to reflect on this morning. At this point in their walk with Jesus the disciples were still very much in the process of coming to terms with who Jesus was. Peter had confessed that he was the Christ \u2013 yet did not understand what that implied, what was required of Jesus. When, in the story we read today, Peter sees Jesus with Moses and Elijah, he wants to cling to that, to perpetuate that experience. But this is not to be; it is but a precursor of something deeper, more profound. They are aware of none other than God himself bearing witness to Jesus \u2013 and they are terrified.\n\nJesus comes to them and touches them, just as he touched the leper, the halt and the blind and says, 'Get up; don\u2019t be afraid.' We often make the mistake of thinking that Jesus only makes himself known, only draws close to those who fully understand, fully know who he is and what he came to do \u2013 that he stands aloof from those who do not fully know, who do not fully understand. Jesus comes to us in the midst of our searching, in the midst of our struggle to understand, in the midst of our often struggling discipleship. He is there with us on the storm tossed waters of life \u2013 not standing on the beach waiting for us to struggle ashore; he is there with the father desperately worried for his son; he is there with two sisters grieving for their brother Lazarus, with the woman who, as the self righteous look on, comes to wash his feet with her tears.\n\nWe do not live our life in isolation from the rest of life but in the midst of life. Prior to his return to the Father, Matthew tells us of Jesus\u2019 promise to his disciples that he would be with them always, to the very end of time.\n\nAs we prepare to embark on the season of Lent, as we prepare in heart and mind to follow Jesus\u2019 journey to Jerusalem, as we seek to deepen our understanding of Jesus, of his teaching, his life, his death and resurrection, as we wrestle with all the ups and downs of life, may we know that we do so in his presence and in his power.",
