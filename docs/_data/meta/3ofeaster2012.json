    "blurb": "In this sermon, Kevin Brew discusses the concept of identity and how it relates to our faith. He uses the story of Jesus appearing to his disciples after the resurrection to illustrate how our identity in Christ is not just about our physical characteristics, but also about our values and priorities. He emphasizes the importance of being witnesses of Christ's love and peace, and challenges us to shine as lights in the world.",
    "raw_text": "Not so very long ago I had to call at the sorting office in Baldoyle. The postman had called at the Rectory to deliver a parcel and there was no one at home. He left a note telling me to call at the sorting office to collect it myself. When I went there to ask for the item I was asked, \u201cDo you have any photo identification?\u201d The man at the counter wanted to know who I was; he wanted to be sure that I was not trying to get hold of a parcel that wasn\u2019t mine.\n\nThat set me thinking about ways in which we can be identified. There is of course the photo in my passport that I showed to the man behind the counter. But there are lots of other ways in which we can be identified. People will recognise our voice or even the sound of our footsteps along the corridor. Then of course there are more precise ways this can be done. There are those collections of lines and whirls on the end of my fingers, my fingerprint that is unique to me. There is my DNA, that complicated molecule in every cell of my body that is again unique to me \u2013 that determines the colour of my eyes, my hair, my skin, what height I am going to grow to along with many other characteristics that we are only now beginning to understand.\n\nAll of these, my photo, the colour of my eyes and hair, the sound of my voice, my fingertips, my DNA, they all prove that this is Kevin Brew standing in front of you and not some imposter pretending to be me. But do these tell me who I am, what sort of person I am, what are my values, what are my priorities in life. Of course they don\u2019t. You would need to get to know me, to see how I behave, how I think.\n\nThis morning in our Gospel passage, Luke tells us of Jesus appearing to his disciples after the resurrection. They were in the upper room. Now they had seen that the tomb was empty. Some of the women had told them that they had seen angels at the tomb telling them he was alive, Mary Magdalene had even said that she had seen them. They were confused and worried, wondering what to do next.\n\nHe showed them his hands and his feet - marks of his identity. They see these and we are told that they knew who he was; their beloved Master who was crucified, the one they had felt powerless to help. He was the one they had followed; they had heard him teach, seen him heal, seen him do remarkable things. But these marks on his hands and his feet do more than just confirm his identity. Those marks are signs of love, self emptying, self forgetting love \u2013 in which nothing is held back, embodying in his own person the statement \u2018God is love\u2019; they put flesh on the declaration, \u2018God so loved the world that he gave\u2019\n\nAnd he says to this startled group of men and women, \u2018Peace be with you.\u2019 Peace to men and women whose lives had been turned upside down, to those who knew their weakness and failure. But when he says \u2018Peace be with you\u2019 he is saying a lot more than just peace in the privacy of your own heart, a sort of cosy peace that they can keep to themselves. This is a peace that will enable to move out from this room in which they had been hiding themselves; move out not in fear but in confidence.\n\nHe goes on to say. \u2018You will be my witnesses.\u2019 Witnesses are those who not only see and hear but those who are prepared to share what they have seen and heard. This group are to go out from that room in which they had been hiding and speak boldly of Jesus as risen and crucified. In a short period of time the message they proclaim will spread right across the whole Roman Empire. For many, like Peter, their witness will cost them their lives.\n\nOur Baptism reminds us that we are called to be witnesses in our own generation of the risen Christ. At the end of a service of Baptism I will say to the child:\n\nYou have received the light of Christ.\nWalk in this light all the days of your life.\nShine as a light in the world\nto the glory of God the Father.\n\nThat is what we are called to do, to shine as a light in this world, in our homes, in our schools and places of work. As a community and as individuals to be living signs of reconciliation in the places of discord, of integrity and truth in the face of falsehood, of love in the places of hate, of hope in places of fear., to be Christ in the world of today.\n\nWhen we go out from this place, we take in the words of the post communion prayer, \u201courselves, our souls and bodies to be a living sacrifice. Send us out in the power of your Spirit to live and work to your praise and glory.\u201d We go out as witnesses, as ones who have been with the Lord, as ones who serve the Lord.\n\nOur service will be imperfect, our witness will at times be flawed but God has a strange way of using the imperfect and the flawed to shine something of the light of his love, to reveal something of his Christ in this broken and imperfect world. May God take us and use us this week, may we be his light in the world of today.",

    "prompt": "Create a black and white pencil sketch that abstractly represents the true essence of a person beyond physical appearance. The image should feature a silhouette of a human figure standing in the center, surrounded by various symbols that represent different aspects of personality and character. These symbols include a heart for love, a light bulb for ideas and creativity, a puzzle piece for uniqueness, a book for knowledge, and a compass for moral direction. The figure is casting a shadow that morphs into a tree, symbolizing growth and life experiences. No religious symbols or text should be included, and the focus should be on the universal human experience of developing one's inner self.",
    "summary": "From the sermon text provided, here are the top 4 concepts:\n\n1. **Identity Verification**: The story of needing to show photo identification to collect a parcel, which leads to a reflection on the various ways we can be identified (e.g., photo ID, fingerprints, DNA).\n\n2. **True Essence of a Person**: The distinction between physical identifiers and the deeper aspects of who a person is, such as their values, priorities, and character.\n\n3. **Marks of Sacrifice and Love**: The description of Jesus showing his hands and feet to his disciples as proof of his identity and as symbols of his love and sacrifice.\n\n4. **Witness and Service**: The call for the congregation to be witnesses of the risen Christ in their daily lives, to shine as a light in the world, and to serve with integrity and love despite imperfections.\n\nFor a non-religious black and white pencil diagram that can be graphically represented, the concept of \"True Essence of a Person\" seems most suitable. It is abstract and can be depicted in a way that is not overtly religious.\n\n**Detailed Prompt for DALL-E 3:**\n\n\"Create a black and white pencil sketch that abstractly represents the true essence of a person beyond physical appearance.
