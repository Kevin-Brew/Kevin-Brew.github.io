blurb: "This sermon uses the metaphor of a pet to explore the challenges and rewards of parenthood. It highlights the responsibilities and dedication required in raising a child, from constant care and attention to dealing with mess and mischief. The sermon concludes with a surprise reveal, using a mirror to show that the 'special pet' is in fact the listener themselves, prompting reflection on self-care and personal growth."

Anyone have a pet?
Would anyone like a pet? What sort?

I have a pet here - a very special sort of pet.
Anyone like to look after it for me?
Warning - it does take quite a bit of looking after.
When young needs feeding maybe 8 times a day - even in the middle of the night.
Makes a rather smelly mess at times that has to be cleaned up - needs lots of baths.

As it gets bigger you have to spend a lot of time talking to it, playing with it, taking it for walks - can be a bit naughty and also leave quite a lot of mess around the house when it is playing.

Then there is the worry, sleepless nights - this stage lasts a long time, years, all the times it is growing. As it gets older it could get into quite a bit of trouble. It will actually grow to be as big as you are.

Anyone like to have a look at this special pet?

Who would have the patience to look after a pet like that?
