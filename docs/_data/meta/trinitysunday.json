    "blurb": "Kevin reflects on the importance of taking scripture seriously, drawing from the Gospel reading for Trinity Sunday. He emphasizes the 'poverty of our faith' as a humble acknowledgment of our partial and provisional understanding, likening our spiritual journey to a child's growth. The sermon also touches on the inclusive nature of Jesus' commission to make disciples, even among those who doubt, and the constant presence of God in our lives regardless of our clarity or doubts about faith.",

God honours, God works\nwith the faith we have at any particular point. This \u2018poverty of our faith\u2019 is to\nacknowledge the insight of Paul is his 1st Letter to the Church at Corinth:\n11 When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I\nreasoned like a child; when I became an adult, I put an end to childish\nways. 12 For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then we will see face to\nface. Now I know only in part; then I will know fully, even as I have\nbeen fully known. 1 Cor 13\nAt the 11:00 service today we are celebrating the sacrament of Baptism as\nwelcome baby Emma Christina into the fellowship of the Church. At the heart\nof the service lie the promises of Baptism:\nIn baptism, God calls us from darkness into his marvellous light.\nTo follow Christ means dying to sin and rising to new life with him.\nTherefore I ask:\nDo you reject the devil and all proud rebellion against God?\nI reject them.\nDo you renounce the deceit and corruption of evil?\nI renounce them.\nDo you repent of the sins that separate us from God and neighbour?\nI repent of them.\nDo you turn to Christ as Saviour?\nI turn to Christ.\nDo you submit to Christ as Lord?\nI submit to Christ.\nDo you come to Christ, the Way, the Truth and the Life?\nI come to Christ.\nAs I frequently remark on these occasions, these are not questions of people\nwho have arrived, who have got it all sorted; they are questions of people on a\njourney. A journey is by its very nature a work in progress, there is always\nfurther to travel. We are all at different points on that journey, a journey into\nfaith, a journey into Christ.\nPage 3 of 4\nTrinity Sunday \u2013 2011 \u2013 year A\nEmma is at the start of that journey of life, of faith \u2013 who knows what lies\nahead for this child? Her parents will have their hopes, their dreams for their\nchild. At different stages in her life their will be occasions of great pride, at\nothers times of anxiety.\nA day such as this is an opportunity for us all to reflect on what stage we are at\non our own pilgrimage of faith. I would have no doubt that some are in a good\nplace. Life is good. But there will be others who are in a darker place, with\nanxieties either for ourselves or for someone close to us. For some the things\nof God are very clear; there is a clear understanding of God living and active in\nour lives. But for others God feels more distant; his place in our lives, our\nunderstanding of his concern for us more tenuous. The important thing is that\nGod is there. On certain days the summit of Howth may disappear under a\ncloud. The cloud may obscure our view but the summit is still there.\nIn Christ he has promised to be with us to the end of time. There is a blessing I\nwould often use at the end of a service. On a number of occasions couples\nhave asked me to use it at their wedding:\nGo, and know that the Lord goes with you:\nlet him lead you each day into the quiet place\nof your heart, where he will speak with you;\nknow that he watches over you \u2013\nthat he listens to you in gentle understanding,\nthat he is with you always,\nwherever you are and however you may feel:\nand the blessing of God Almighty,\nthe Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit\nbe upon you and remain with you always.\nAmen.\nknow that he watches over you \u2013 that he listens to you in gentle understanding,\nthat he is with you always, wherever you are and however you may feel.\nPage 4 of 4\nTrinity Sunday \u2013 2011 \u2013 year A\nThey worshipped him but some doubted. For some everything had fallen into\nplace \u2013 for others it still seemed too good to be true. But to all the Risen Christ\ngives the same commission and promises the same presence \u2018I will be with you\nalways, to the very end of time.\u2019\nGod comes to each of us this day. He accepts the poverty of our faith. We are\neach a particular focus of his love. to each one of us he says, \u2018Go in my name\n\u2026. into your home, your street, your place of work and I will be with you \u2026\nwherever you are and however you may feel."
