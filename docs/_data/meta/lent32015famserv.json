    "blurb": "The sermon focuses on the importance of following God's 'recipe' for life. It uses the analogy of baking a cake, emphasizing that just as a cake requires the right ingredients and instructions, so does a fulfilling life require adherence to God's teachings. The sermon was part of a service involving a confirmation class, who are preparing to affirm their faith.",
    "raw_text": "Today after service we are going to taste results of people's baking. Thought I would have a go. Could I have some helpers? Ask for flour, eggs, water, oil etc \u2013 mix it up \u2013 place in tin - anyone want to lick the spoon? You don't think it will turn out like that. What's wrong? \u2013 haven't followed the recipe, haven't followed the rules.\n\nThis morning our confirmation class are helping in our service, reading lessons, leading prayers. As they get ready for their confirmation we are beginning to think about God \u2013 God who made this wonderful world, God as our Father, a Father who wants the very best for us, to live life to the full.",
