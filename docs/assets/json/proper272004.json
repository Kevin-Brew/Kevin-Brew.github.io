    "blurb": "In this sermon, Kevin explores the concept of human understanding of God's knowledge. He emphasizes the importance of acknowledging our limitations and the incomprehensibility of God. Drawing from various biblical passages and personal experiences, Kevin encourages the acceptance of uncertainty and the pursuit of faith, even in the face of unanswered questions.",
    "raw_text": "\"Gentlemen, we just don't know, do we?\"\n\nI can still see Rev Dr Freddy Vokes, Archbishop King's Professor of Divinity, who lectured me in New Testament and Church History, standing with a glint in his eye. We had tried to tie him down on some point of interpretation as he lectured us on St John's Gospel - he just looked back at us and said in his sing song English voice, \"Gentlemen, we just don't know, do we?\" For some of us that was quite infuriating. Questions had answers and answers were either right or they were wrong. I actually found it quite liberating as Freddy went on to say, \"Sometimes the most honest thing I can say is 'I don't know'.\"\n\nMany people came to Jesus with questions - there were questions that came from the heart, questions that represented a search for truth, for meaning in the face of suffering. Then there were the questions, such as we read of this morning, that were intended to entrap, or trip him up, questions \"that would cross a rabbi's eyes\".\n\nJesus discouraged speculation. On different occasions people, including the disciples, came to him with questions for which there was no answer. On more than one occasion he was asked when was the Father going to bring in the Kingdom, to which Jesus replied, \"Not even the Son of Man knows\". Jesus felt comfortable living with uncertainty in the context of his total trust in God.\n\nThe apostle Paul, as he reflected on the mystery of Christian love, acknowledged the limitations of his own knowledge in his first letter to the Church at Corinth, [9] For we know in part and we prophesy in part, [10] but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears. [11] When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me. [12] Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known. (1 Cor. 13:9-12)\n\nBefore God all of us are able to see but dimly. Like Paul, all of us need to acknowledge the limitations and imperfection of our knowledge of God. The early theologians of the Church as they sought, in the light of Scripture, to understand the nature of God used the term incomprehensible. They used this term not in the sense that we cannot know him, rather that we cannot define him, describe him as we can aspects of his creation - he is beyond our understanding.\n\nWe began thinking about questions that were asked of Jesus. There were questions from the heart, questions seeking meaning and purpose and then there were questions that were simply designed to \"cross a rabbi's eyes\", to trip him up, to entrap him. Questions asked by people who though they knew all the answers. Their certainty arose from hearts that were closed, impervious to ideas other than their own. They had no conception of God outside their own definitions. We too can seek to restrict God to the limits of our own understanding, our own definitions.\n\nJesus pointed them beyond a God of their own formulae to the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, God not of the dead but of the living. A God whom we not only worship but with whom we can engage.\n\nI frequently thank God for Freddy Vokes and his simple yet profound observation, \"Gentlemen, we just don't know, do we? Sometimes the most honest thing I can say is that I don't know.\"\n\nIt is as I confess that I don't know, that I don't have all the answers that my heart is opened to the God and Father of my Lord Jesus Christ and with Paul I confess in my heart, \"Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.\" (1 Cor 13:9)",

I\nactually found it quite liberating as Freddy went on to say, \"Sometimes the most\nhonest thing I can say is 'I don't know'.\"\nAnother thought that came to me as I read our Gospel reading for this morning was\nthe character Topol in the film \"Fiddler on the Roof\". He was a poor Jewish man\nliving in Czarist Russia who had an ongoing dialogue with God as why he had been\nput on this earth as a poor man. At one point he asked \"Would it spoil some vast\neternal plan if I were a wealthy man?\" He used to think about the sort of things he\ncould do if he was rich. One of the things he would be able to do would be to\nspend time at the synagogue, talking with the rabbis about his faith, asking\nquestions, \"questions that would cross a rabbi's eyes\".\nMany people came to Jesus with questions - there were questions that came from\nthe heart, questions that represented a search for truth, for meaning in the face of\nsuffering. Then there were the questions, such as we read of this morning, that\nwere intended to entrap, or trip him up, questions \"that would cross a rabbi's eyes\".\nI think it is worth reminding ourselves that Jesus discouraged speculation. On\ndifferent occasions people, including the disciples, came to him with questions for\nwhich there was no answer. On more than one occasion he was asked when was\nthe Father going to bring in the Kingdom, to which Jesus replied, \"Not even the Son\nof Man knows\". Jesus felt comfortable living with uncertainty in the context of his\n3rd Sunday before Advent - 2004 - year C - morning service\nPage 2\ntotal trust in God.\nAnd yet we still feel we ought to know the answers to questions such as these - and\nthat can slip over into an arrogance of thinking that we do know, that we do have\nthe answers and that everyone else is wrong.\nThe apostle Paul, as he reflected on the mystery of Christian love, acknowledged\nthe limitations of his own knowledge in his first letter to the Church at Corinth,\n[9] For we know in part and we prophesy in part, [10] but when\nperfection comes, the imperfect disappears. [11] When I was a child, I\ntalked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I\nbecame a man, I put childish ways behind me. [12] Now we see but a poor\nreflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part;\nthen I shall know fully, even as I am fully known. (1 Cor. 13:9-12)\nBefore God all of us are able to see but dimly. Like Paul, all of us need to\nacknowledge the limitations and imperfection of our knowledge of God. The early\ntheologians of the Church as they sought, in the light of Scripture, to understand the\nnature of God used the term incomprehensible. They used this term not in the sense\nthat we cannot know him, rather that we cannot define him, describe him as we can\naspects of his creation - he is beyond our understanding.\nWe know him as our creator, we encounter him in creation as we gaze in wonder at\na night sky or sunset or stop to reflect on the amazing complexity and beauty of life\nin all its forms from the simplest of organisms to the wonder of our own bodies, the\nability to hear, to smell, to taste, to see. My own spiritual pilgrimage began in a\ngrowing wonder at the beauty of this world and the underlying order that science\nreveals - from the smallest of particles that make up the atom to the enormity of the\nuniverse of which this earth is but a tiniest part. What am I in all of this? It was a\nquestion such as this that evoked from the Psalmist those lovely words that we find\nin Psalm 8\n\" When I consider your heavens,\nthe work of your fingers,\n3rd Sunday before Advent - 2004 - year C - morning service\nPage 3\nthe moon and the stars,\nwhich you have set in place,\nwhat is man that you are mindful of him,\nthe son of man that you care for him?\nThe very posing of the question \"What is man?\", asked in the context of wonder, in\nitself leads us towards the answer. The admission that we do not know why God\nshould bother with sinful man opens us up to the realisation that he does, opens our\nhearts to the significance of Jesus, his teaching, his death and resurrection and\nmoves us to worship.\nWe began thinking about questions that were asked of Jesus. There were questions\nfrom the heart, questions seeking meaning and purpose and then there were\nquestions that were simply designed to \"cross a rabbi's eyes\", to trip him up, to\nentrap him. Questions asked by people who though they knew all the answers.\nTheir certainty arose from hearts that were closed, impervious to ideas other than\ntheir own. They had no conception of God outside their own definitions. We too\ncan seek to restrict God to the limits of our own understanding, our own definitions.\nJesus pointed them beyond a God of their own formulae to the God of Abraham,\nthe God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, God not of the dead but of the living. A God\nwhom we not only worship but with whom we can engage.\nI frequently thank God for Freddy Vokes and his simple yet profound observation,\n\"Gentlemen, we just don't know, do we? Sometimes the most honest thing I can\nsay is that I don't know.\"\nIt is as I confess that I don't know, that I don't have all the answers that my heart is\nopened to the God and Father of my Lord Jesus Christ and with Paul I confess in\nmy heart, \"Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to\nface. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.\" (1\nCor 13:9)\n3rd Sunday before Advent - 2004 - year C - morning service"
