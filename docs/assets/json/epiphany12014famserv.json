    "blurb": "This sermon, delivered on the first Sunday of Epiphany in 2014, discusses the concept of being different and standing out in a crowd. The sermon emphasizes the importance of choosing to follow Christ, which means dying to sin and rising to new life with him. It also highlights the concept of repentance, using the Greek word 'metanoia', which means to turn around, change direction, and take a different journey through life.",
    "raw_text": "Can anyone tell me where this place is? St Andrew\u2019s \u2013 home ground of Birmingham City Football Club. There can be some pretty scary supporters. In recent years we haven\u2019t had much to cheer about. We did win the League Cup back in 2008. I won\u2019t gloat about one side that was knocked out of the League Cup. There aren\u2019t many supporters here in Howth \u2013 Maurice Bishop and I used to console each other on a Sunday morning. In fact you could say that to be a supporter of Birmingham City is to stand out as different from everyone else.\n\nThis morning I want to talk of ways of being different, of standing out in a crowd. Some people dress differently and do their hair differently. Then we are all different. God loves us all, no matter where we come from, how old we are \u2013 even how we dress. The difference we are talking about this morning is who we follow.\n\nLesson told of Baptism of Jesus \u2013 I want to think about our own Baptism. When we have a Baptism, at one point in the service I will say: In baptism, God calls us from darkness into his marvellous light. To follow Christ means dying to sin and rising to new life with him. That means very consciously choosing \u2013 choosing different attitudes, different behaviours, different priorities in life in the sort of people we choose to be.\n\nBible talks about repentance \u2013 it uses a Greek word: metanoia. That\u2019s what John and Jesus meant when they told people to \u2018repent\u2019. Turn around, change direction, take a different journey through life.",
